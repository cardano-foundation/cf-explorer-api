This awareness not only facilitates engagement with the broader ecosystem but also encourages active participation in its development. Consequently, the Cardano Foundation consistently advocates for and engages in educational endeavors, aiming to demystify blockchain and decentralization concepts for a broad spectrum of stakeholders. During last year, the Foundation continued to engage with post-secondary institutions and generated community discussions through efforts like the “Let’s Talk Cardano” webinar series. The Cardano Academy also stands as a notable example of furthering an understanding of blockchain technology. ## Delivering blockchain education ![Cardano Academy - Empowering the digital architects of the future](https://ucarecdn.com/6093586d-a5c7-4aa1-bc00-24bc405298ba/ \"Cardano Academy - Empowering the digital architects of the future\") Earlier in 2023, the Foundation launched the Alpha Program of the [Cardano Academy](https://academy.cardanofoundation.org/), inviting select users to access and trial the new platform. Following this initial soft launch, the Foundation proceeded with the [full-service launch](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-foundation-2023-products-to-advance-blockchain/) in December 2023. The Foundation is pleased to announce that for the Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate (CBCA) course, users will soon be able to obtain the Associate Certification—with exam bookings available in the first half of 2024. We also made [Cardano Academy content available to Petrobras](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-foundation-announces-education-partnership-with-petrobras-1/), the government-owned energy giant in Brazil. Through this partnership, the Foundation will spearhead educational workshops for Petrobras employees, expanding understanding and expediting the adoption of blockchain technology. During the sessions, participants will examine the vast potential of blockchain, explore its various use cases and applications, and complete interactive quizzes covering related topics. The Cardano Foundation hosted two workshops in the Metaverse to mark the program's initiation, one of which delved into global and Brazilian regulatory considerations. Additionally, the Foundation and Cardano Academy are providing Petrobras with CBCA content for employee training initiatives. Upon successful completion of the blockchain course, participants will receive a certificate. Additionally, the first 500 Petrobras attendees of the Cardano Academy will collect a unique NFT. This NFT, developed in collaboration with the Petrobras Education Board, will dynamically evolve, reflecting the progress of participants in their training. ## Bringing blockchain education and research Engaging in academic pursuits and research within the realm of blockchain proves crucial for advancing comprehension of its underlying principles, cryptographic mechanisms, and distributed consensus protocols. This academic exploration not only fosters a nuanced understanding of blockchain technology but also facilitates the development of sophisticated solutions to address its inherent challenges. As such, the Foundation engages in rigorous academic inquiry, as well as sponsoring and contributing to blockchain research. Notably, Manvir Schneider (Research Scientist at the Foundation) presented the paper “[MACS: A Multi-Asset Coin Selection Algorithm for UTXO-based Blockchains](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411438)\" at the [6th IEEE International Conference on Blockchain 2023](https://ieee-cybermatics.org/2023/blockchain/index.php). Additionally, Schneider, along with Mel McCann (Vice President of Engineering) and Reza Ramezan (Research and Education Lead), authored a paper titled “[A Survey on Coin Selection Algorithms in UTXO-based Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01113),” which is under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The Foundation also nurtures relationships with post-secondary institutions through in-person and virtual engagements as well as [sponsorships](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/a-commitment-to-education-the-cardano-foundation-strengthens-ties-with-the-university-of-zurich/). For example, over three weeks, the University of Zurich's (UZH) “Deep Dive Into Blockchain” Summer School program hosted over 40 esteemed academic and industry professionals from around the globe, delivering sessions both online and on-campus. These sessions focused on comprehensive blockchain education, from its fundamental workings to future applications of decentralized technology. The Cardano Foundation sponsored 12 students for this program while also introducing Cardano to 70 students — 40 in person and 30 virtually. To commence the Foundation’s involvement, Alexandre Maaza (Sustainability Lead) first provided an introduction to Cardano and the Cardano Foundation’s work. Thomas Mayfield (Team Lead of Decentralized Trust and Identity Solutions) then went on to discuss several fundamental properties of blockchain protocols such as block data structure, transaction models, staking and rewards, real-world use cases, and getting started as a developer on Cardano. To conclude, Mateusz Czeladka (Senior Java Developer) presented on smart contract development with Aiken using the [Yaci DevKit](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-devkit). With Czeladka’s assistance and a previous showcase, students completed [tutorial exercises](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/aiken-lucid-yaci-dev-kit-starter-kit). In another session, Dr. Claudio Tessone of UZH noted how the Cardano Foundation contributed to bringing students from all over the world to the Summer School. CEO Frederik Gregaard then took the stage to deliver a keynote that highlighted the uniqueness of the Summer School program and its ability to bring non-technical people and experts together. Ultimately, he noted, Cardano is about bringing people together; not just that, but the ethos of blockchain actually envisions decentralization in a scenario where people must come before code. Following Gregaard's session, both [NMKR](https://muesliswap.com/swap) and [MuesliSwap](https://muesliswap.com/swap) teams presented, culminating in thought-provoking discussions about the possibilities and advantages of blockchain, including in the context of finance and the arts. Expanding our commitment to comprehensive blockchain education, Ramezan further enhanced our academic footprint by delivering a half-day session on Cardano's technology during the Blockchain Summer School program hosted by the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada. ## Education through engagement ![Let's Talk Cardano Week - Webinar series by the Cardano Foundation](https://ucarecdn.com/a1cbad87-e8f0-4a8d-b8dd-6333f42d94d6/ \"Let's Talk Cardano Week - Webinar series by the Cardano Foundation\") In the second half of 2023, the Foundation continued its “Let’s Talk Cardano” series, exploring topics in a format that fosters discussion on topics important to Cardano users and others in the blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, these sessions allow the Foundation to share useful information with those not yet involved in the industry, providing participants with an opportunity to connect with solutions providers. One such webinar reflected on Switzerland for [UNHCR’s year-long collaboration with the Cardano community](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-foundation-and-switzerland-for-unhcr-recognized-for-philanthropy-innovation/). The session, led by Switzerland for UNHCR’s Alvaro Cosi (Head of Communications & Innovation) and Ruxanda Cornescu (Communications Associate), examined the integration of blockchain and Web 3.0 technologies in humanitarian initiatives, highlighting Web 3.0 challenges and aspirations. The [next session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nNF_Y4eDcA) showcased [Zero Citizen's](https://zerocitizen.io/) efforts in combining technology with environmental sustainability. Led by project CEO Ben Bonner and CTO Thomas Langlois, the webinar delved into the use of blockchain for sustainable solutions, including tokenized carbon credits and fractionalizing renewable energy assets, reflecting Zero Citizen's role in ClimateTech. For the [following webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y3KTXHVF44), Peter Van Garderen of [Orcfax Ltd.](https://orcfax.io/) discussed the crucial role of oracles in DeFi. The session combined theoretical insights and practical demonstrations on integrating the Orcfax oracle data with Cardano DApps, highlighting the role of decentralized oracles in the DeFi ecosystem. The last [“Let's Talk Cardano”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aAcG3rAuIY) session of 2023 examined the inner workings of [Genius Yield's DEX](https://www.geniusyield.co/), a decentralized exchange built for the Cardano ecosystem. In this webinar, Genius Yield’s Marvin Bertin and Dr. Lars Brünjes discussed the DEX's functionalities, including a live trade demo and insights into Smart Order Routers, emphasizing its role in decentralized trading and the future of blockchain finance. In hosting sessions like the “Let’s Talk Cardano” series, the Foundation continues to advance blockchain awareness for a diverse range of stakeholders. Additionally, platforms like Cardano Academy, partnerships with the likes of Petrobras, and a post-secondary presence reinforce our focus on empowering individuals and organizations through comprehensive blockchain education. As we work to further emphasize exploration, collaboration, and community involvement, the Foundation encourages all community members to participate in our educational efforts—furthering Cardano as a resilient public infrastructure.","default_content":"Discover the potential of blockchain with the Cardano Foundation's educational initiatives.

The award, granted on 30 January 2024 in Brussels, recognizes the impact of this novel, community-supported approach to advancing humanitarian aid through a charity stake pool known as “With Refugees” ([WRFGS](https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/en/staking-lifecycle/spo/pool1dmnyhw9uthknzcq4q6pwdc4vtfxz5zzrvd9eg432u60lzl959tw/timeline/operator-rewards/)). This approach stands as a prime example of how new solutions can bridge the gap between traditional funding models and blockchain solutions. The forcible displacement of people is one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time. Using emerging technologies to apply innovative approaches to situations like this can help to ensure those affected by war, famine, extreme weather events, or other tragedies receive prompt and appropriate assistance. Models like the one created by the Cardano Foundation and Switzerland for UNHCR not only generate the usual philanthropic support but actually allow donors a more efficient way of guaranteeing their efforts have meaningful and longstanding effects. ## Impact staking changes lives Crisis intervention through humanitarian aid has an essential role in minimizing the costs to human lives and preserving dignity when a large-scale tragedy occurs. Humanitarian organizations, such as UNHCR, do incredible work to support forcibly displaced people. However, classic donation models present a challenge. To provide consistent support, an organization needs to have a dependable pool of funding. Traditionally, donor funding comes in higher volumes during humanitarian emergencies with high media coverage. However, donors often earmark their donations to a specific crisis, leading to an unbalanced distribution of resources that makes continuing support challenging. When attention to those crises diminishes, so does donor engagement, resulting in donor retention that is cyclical and inconsistent. UNHCR currently identifies 14 protracted, less mediatised crises with chronic underfunding. Impact staking provides a direct response to that challenge. Rather than the typical approach of donating directly to a charity, it establishes a mechanism for providing ongoing support, offering reliable and consistent support to philanthropic organizations like Switzerland for UNHCR, even when media coverage or public attention dims. ## Optimizing donation models The Switzerland for UNHCR and Cardano Foundation project both maximizes the potential of donations and creates the conditions to address chronically underfunded crises. By relying on non-earmarked donations, it allows UNHCR to exercise its expertise in deciding where best to allocate funds. Ada holders can delegate their stake to the WRFGS pool, with the pool directing any generated rewards towards Switzerland for UNHCR. Of these, 80% go to address the most pressing needs of refugees from the underfunded crises, with several UNHCR Innovation Funds then receiving the remaining 20%. Other models of donation could further enhance the current one. A corporate pledge program, for instance, might see donations in both the company’s and the employees’ names, not only amplifying the impact of a company’s social efforts but also increasing employee engagement. A parallel program could also establish a system for employees to make direct contributions via their payrolls, whereas a more long-term option might allocate a predetermined amount of funds to a stake pool, with the added flexibility to withdraw at specific stages and consider prudent reinvestment strategies. These tailored approaches exemplify but a few of many possible models of impact staking. In fact, the Foundation and Switzerland for UNHCR currently study several new options. Organizations interested in custom mechanisms can also [reach out](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetfyhy-Curt9RFF5u6wcD6WnZboeAiKMTY6Jz_MXK83kPZgQ/viewform?usp=send_form) requesting an appointment to further discuss their specific case. ## A year of impact staking This recent [recognition by INATBA](https://inatba.org/press-release/inatba-awards-2024-inspiring-the-future-of-blockchain-excellence/) becomes ever more meaningful as it helps to showcase how blockchain technology can be utilized to solve world problems. It can even help to reach new audiences and mobilize worldwide communities. Indeed, none of this recognition or achievement would be possible without the generous support of the Cardano community. In addition to the Foundation’s initial delegation of 3.5 million ada, the community has since inception delegated over 1.7million ada. The Cardano Foundation wishes to thank everyone who made a contribution, created charity NFT collections and developed other [awareness initiatives](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/driving-blockchain-technology-cardano-foundation%E2%80%99s-activities-part-6/) around the WRFGS stake pool, or otherwise aided in bringing it to a wider audience’s attention. One year later, this collaboration keeps growing stronger and helping lives around the world. Anyone interested can easily delegate in four straightforward steps. ![Four steps to stake ada](https://ucarecdn.com/3e22d27f-d26c-43d6-8a25-3ca75a41a980/ \"Four steps to stake ada\") To keep up on the latest updates of the first-ever UN blockchain validator, follow [Switzerland for UNHCR](https://twitter.com/UNHCR_CH_Innov) and [WRFGS](https://twitter.com/Wrfgs_pool) on X (formerly known as Twitter).

[Operational resilience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89d8t72C4Uk) encompasses all efforts to improve Cardano’s suitability and recognition as an infrastructure component of institutional-grade use cases. To this end, Cardano stake pool operators (SPOs) play a pivotal role in validating and adding new blocks to the blockchain. By running and maintaining stake pools, SPOs contribute to the security, stability, and overall health of the Cardano ecosystem. Moreover, SPOs facilitate decentralization by encouraging widespread participation through stake delegation, enabling individuals to actively engage in the network's governance and decision-making processes. A growing number of stake-relevant pools or nodes paired with more on-chain participation further contributes to the network’s decentralization. Specifically, the distributed nature of stake pools enhances the network's resistance to centralized control or malicious attacks, fostering a robust and resilient infrastructure. Throughout 2023, the Foundation highlighted the work of SPOs and engaged with them in a number of ways. From parameter updates to targeted masterclasses during the Cadano Summit 2023, we sought to provide assistance around multiple relevant topics. ## Masterclasses Curated for SPOs ![SPO Masterclass - Cardano Summit 2023 - Dubai](https://ucarecdn.com/4036b429-7a09-4265-81dc-9729c34f5e0f/ \"SPO Masterclass - Cardano Summit 2023 - Dubai\") From 2 to 4 November 2023, the [Cardano Summit](https://summit.cardano.org/) held a main stage event in Dubai, with more than 25 community-led events worldwide and thousands of virtual attendees across the continents. In addition to the Main Stage and Pitch Arena panels, a variety of subject matter experts presented to diverse audiences. The Foundation also curated a series of discussions specifically for SPOs, acknowledging the critical role they play in monitoring and maintaining the Cardano network. In one such session, the Foundation’s Markus Gufler, Technical Community Lead, delivered the [SPO Masterclass: Cardano Network Health Monitoring Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hahYBjNrhEs), which provided attendees with a comprehensive demonstration of the Cardano [network health monitoring tool](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/blockperf). This tool equips SPOs with a unique way to understand the scope and limits of pool operations, as well as the global network, by combining telemetry data together. Professor Claudio J. Tessone and Dr. Sheng-Nan Li from the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) also led the [SPO Masterclass: Cardano Tokenomics at the Stake Pool Level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfEKcReV7GI), exploring a powerful blockchain analytics approach. Specifically, the two presented a better visualization and long-term support for proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol design by covering three main topics: 1. Algorithm of address clustering based on the E-UTxO pattern. 2. Data analytics on the trade-off between inclusivity and decentralization in stake and reward distribution of ada. 3. The framework of modeling and evaluating ada tokenomics. In the [SPO Masterclass: Legal and Regulatory Aspects of Staking Mechanisms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu7FmlpoUaM), D.Jur. Nicola Massella of [STORM Partners](https://storm.partners/) delved into the world of staking. In addition to breaking down the different types of staking mechanisms available, Massella went on to compare US and EU approaches to crypto regulations and the precedents that currently guide policymaking. The [SPO Masterclass: (Hardware) Wallet Security and Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoGaj7QwsTs) session led by Chris \\[STR8], founder of [Straight Pool](https://str8pool.com/), further examined SPO and ada holder concerns regarding wallet security. The session aimed to help both parties feel more confident when navigating this complex field, allowing them to assist others and make informed decisions for their own wallet security. Moreover, Ashish Prajapati, Founder of [Strica](https://strica.io/), delivered the [SPO Masterclass: Ouroboros Network Libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puvPsBm6mkA), a comprehensive live demo of the Ouroboros Networking Library meant to help developers gain a good understanding of its potential. The demonstration went beyond theory, offering a clear vision of the library's capabilities and allowing developers to grasp its practical applications. ![SPO Masterclass Participants - Cardano Summit 2023 - Dubai](https://ucarecdn.com/9d6e10cc-8ba4-492c-b5ac-3b4cefa30107/ \"SPO Masterclass Participants - Cardano Summit 2023 - Dubai\") ## Voicing SPOs’ stories At the time of publication, there are more than 3,000 registered stake pools on Cardano, with approximately 1,000 active SPOs performing a fundamental role in monitoring and maintaining the network while also ensuring consistent node uptime. The Cardano Foundation’s “A Spotlight on Stake Pools” series highlights these critical contributions to the operational resilience of today, plus the survivability of Cardano in the future. The series features some of the diverse SPOs across the Cardano ecosystem, with each installment showcasing the work, projects, and open source initiatives of a different SPO. In our [first installment](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/a-spotlight-on-stake-pools-lido-stake-pool/) of 2023, we explored the [Lido Stake Pool](https://www.lidonation.com/en/lido-staking-pool) operated by co-founders Stephanie King and Darlington Wleh, who take a multilayered approach to community building, often contributing to [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/) as well as maintaining the [Lido Nation](https://www.lidonation.com/) website. In addition to publishing Lido News, a community newspaper, they regularly host educational podcasts and X (formerly known as Twitter) Spaces. Next up, we took a closer look at how the [Hazelpool](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/a-spotlight-on-stake-pools-hazelpool/) team works to support the Cardano network while donating to feline fostering and raising awareness of no-kill shelters. Since its inception, founder Nils has built on the [Hazelpool](https://www.hazelpool.com/) ecosystem to include additional tools like the HAZELnet Discord bot. Users can access this tool at no cost by delegating their stake, which further incentivizes network decentralization efforts. More recently, we featured the [AHLNET stake pool](https://ahlnet.nu/), founded by Ola Ahlman. Over his 15-year career in IT management, Ahlman has gained expertise in deploying mission-critical servers in an air traffic control center. Today, he combines his technical expertise with a passion for working on private and open source projects in Java and other programming languages. Ahlman also spoke on his love of travel, regularly immersing himself in local traditions and lifestyles. He credits these experiences for shaping his perception of global social, economic, and ecological issues, all key aspects that led him to Cardano. ## Promoting Active Participation In April and May of 2023, the Cardano Foundation conducted an on-chain poll, built on the mechanisms we proposed in [CIP-0094](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/governance/cardano-improvement-proposals/cip-0094/). After completing the single-question [testnet poll](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/entering-voltaire-on-chain-poll-for-spos/), the [mainnet poll](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/entering-voltaire-poll-experiment-live-on-mainnet/) asked SPOs for their stake-weighted opinion on potential changes to the k and minPoolCost parameters. As a result of the SPO poll and subsequent Parameter Committee recommendation, the minPoolCost parameter was halved in epoch 445. This event occurred on 27 October 2023, reducing the minPoolCost of 340 to 170 ada. The change proves significant for relatively small stake pools, making it an [eagerly awaited update](https://forum.cardano.org/t/the-cardano-foundations-response-to-the-parameter-committee-recommendation-in-pcp-001/121903#the-effect-of-minpoolcost-9). By halving the minPoolCost, SPOs can reduce their floor income, providing them with a more level playing field. Using the parameter change as a practical example, the change-request process can now be thoroughly assessed and set up for [public discussion or refinement as a community-initiated process](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/parameter-change-proposals-pcp/257). This undertaking aims to foster compromise, combine ideas, and bring mature, fully formed proposals to a vote. As a decentralized protocol, instead of a ready-made software product presented to a passive ecosystem, this approach looks to define outcomes together, experiment, identify improvements, and thus move step-by-step toward shared governance. Promoting Cardano as a public infrastructure means that the chain’s operational resilience also depends on the collective efforts of SPOs. This makes focusing on and encouraging collaboration even more crucial. From curated discussions to featured content and on-chain voting mechanisms, the Foundation will continue its commitment to community involvement and shared governance, helping to support Cardano’s evolution."},"name":"driving-blockchain-technology-cardano-foundation’s-activities-part-7-1.md","sha":"c596cf3a8e501ebf9f62989a629ab64f0374cba3","resource_href":"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/driving-blockchain-technology-cardano-foundation’s-activities-part-7-1/"},{"title":"Cardano Foundation Launches 2023 Activity Report ","language":"en","banner_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/7717a592-bafc-4e3e-8ed0-f5d4662c32da/","meta_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/dc1508ca-5459-4ab0-aa96-6185972a7e7c/","thumbnail_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/064856a5-e800-44de-82f5-25bef5f6d035/","layout":"news","news_item_content":{"show_excerpt":"true","date":"2024-02-01T14:35:07.684Z","author":"https://ucarecdn.com/6b3ced46-5e70-43fd-9272-bbb3e1bb9dea/-/crop/1242x772/0,45/-/preview/|Renagh Mooney~~~Global Communications Director","body":"**Zug, Switzerland - 1 February 2024** - The Cardano Foundation, an independent, Swiss-based not-for-profit organization tasked with advancing the public digital infrastructure Cardano, launched its second Activity Report today. The report showcases the Foundation’s work across its three core focus areas of operational resilience, education, and adoption. Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, said, \"As we continue to work at pace to advance the Cardano infrastructure, this report provides an opportunity to take stock of the scope and scale of what we achieved during the year. The team has delivered exceptional work, especially considering the nimble size of the Cardano Foundation. As we navigate the complexities of this brave new digital age, I call upon enterprises and social systems to join us on our blockchain journey. We invite you to partake in a future that is resilient, equitable, and transparent.” In keeping with its central mission of bridging Cardano and the world by working to progress Cardano as a public digital utility, the Cardano Foundation has focused intensively on scaling the diversity, quality, and quantity of activities on Cardano. To do that, it must tackle a number of hurdles, from the cost and complexity of implementation and ownership to lack of comfort with blockchain. The 2023 Activity Report showcases several new projects: **Increasing operational resilience through initiatives, such as:** * Enhanced network monitoring through a project to build real-time monitoring capabilities of global block propagation, to be able to evaluate the health of the network and gain insights to help stake pool operators (SPOs) to enhance their operations. The Foundation’s solution has enabled the collection of data across five continents. * The advent of Voltaire, Cardano’s development phase relating to governance, has included the release of the first draft of CIP-1694. This Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP), co-written by the Foundation, introduced a new, more inclusive and equitable on-chain governance model for Cardano, ensuring every ada holder can have a voice in Cardano’s governance. **Enabling real-world education to a variety of stakeholders, such as:** * Successful new partnerships to advance blockchain adoption and showcase the versatility of the Cardano blockchain, including with Brazilian state-owned energy company Petrobras and full-stack apparel ecosystem Merchadise. * Providing a spectrum of tools and expert resources at no cost, including the Cardano Academy, a free resource housing the Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate (CBCA) course. * Having identified a need for high quality educational materials about third generation blockchain that are accessible to all, the Foundation began to develop the Cardano Explorer so that legal stakeholders can verify that Cardano does what it should. **Fostering adoption through novel initiatives, such as:** * The launch of Aiken, a new open source programming language, in April 2023. The language provides savings in execution costs of up to 90%, lowering barriers for entry into the ecosystem and supporting new innovations. * Freely accessible tools developed by the Foundation like the open source Identity Wallet as well as the searchable, data provisioning tool Ledger Sync, both meant to drive adoption and accelerate enterprise onboarding. * Sustained progress in the Cardano Foundation’s partnership with Switzerland for UNHCR where the Cardano community has already raised 5.2 million ada to support displaced people.

Each installment provides insights from a specific SPO and highlights its initiatives, projects, and commitment to open source practices. In the previous entry, we explored how [Hazelpool](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/a-spotlight-on-stake-pools-hazelpool/) supports the Cardano network while encouraging feline fostering and raising the profile of no-kill shelters. As Hazelpool has grown, so too has its ecosystem, expanding to include tools like the HAZELnet Discord bot. Users can access this tool at no cost by delegating their stake, further incentivizing decentralization efforts. In this installment, we now feature the [AHLNET stake pool](https://ahlnet.nu/), founded by Sweden-based Ola Ahlman. With over 15 years of IT management experience and expertise deploying mission-critical servers in an air traffic control center, Ahlman combines his technical expertise with a passion for working on private and open source projects in Java and other programming languages. Beyond the digital realm, Ahlman enjoys exploring distant corners of the world, immersing himself in local traditions and lifestyles. Ahlman’s travels have cultivated an awareness of social, economic, and ecological issues that shape his worldview. These perspectives align with his mission to amplify Cardano’s message and objectives by operating a stake pool, therefore strengthening network resilience and decentralization. Ahlam’s contributions to Cardano have led to a community vote designating AHLNET as an official stake pool for [SundaeSwap ISO and Scooper](https://sundae.fi/). Ahlman is also a core developer of [Eternl](https://eternl.io/app/mainnet/welcome), a popular Cardano community wallet. ### Why did you become a stake pool operator? When I first came into contact with blockchain back in 2017, it took some time to get a feeling for the crypto landscape, the goals, and the motivations behind each project. Once I stumbled upon Cardano, it didn't take long before I knew that this was the place to set roots and go long. I have always loved to travel the world beyond the normal tourist destinations to actually get a feeling for the local lifestyle, both for their wonders but also, in particular, the challenges and problems that exist around the world. Cardano with its mission to not only be a tool for the established economies but rather really focus on solving the real issues for supply chain verification, banking the unbanked, etc., really hit home. Because of this, I started reading up on the technical aspects of Cardano and how I could get involved to further this vision. I then joined the community channels on [Telegram](https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements) and the [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/) to see how I best could contribute with my particular skill set. This was still in the Early days of Cardano before stake pools were a thing, but from here, the idea of running a Cardano stake pool started to take root. ### What is the mission of your stake pool? With a long technical background in IT/server operation and management, I felt that I could contribute to the overall stability of the network by providing a Cardano stake pool that community users can rely on for optimal operation. A big goal from the start was that I would do so without taking the easy route and getting myself a hosted solution. Instead, everything should be self-hosted. This means running on bare-metal hardware on its own infrastructure (network) to distance myself from clustering all pool operations to popular centralized locations on the globe. As I'm from Sweden, this is where all my Cardano nodes, core block producer, and relays are deployed. Running on my own hardware comes with multiple challenges, especially related to redundancy for power and network (ISP) issues outside of my control. All of this is taken care of by careful design decisions, known to be stable infrastructure in my area of operation, and own built software/scripts for automatic failover in case of a problem. Another early goal of mine in running a stake pool was to run a single stake pool. This allows for maximum chain decentralization and makes room for more successful and sustainable operations. ### Can you give us a brief history of your stake pool? My Cardano journey started by helping out with running and testing the pre-release versions of the first Cardano node software to be used for the ITN (Incentivized TestNet). Once in a \"stable\" state, the dates around the launch of the ITN started to take form. It was time to start thinking of a brand for my pool. Due to being horrible at this stuff, I made it simple: I just went with the first part of my family name AHL, and this became my pool ticker. The ITN started rough, with many sleepless nights due to a few stability issues in the node software. A lot of tinkering with failover scripts, etc. I didn't manage to attract many delegators to my pool for the first half of the ITN. A bit of a bummer, but gave me the time to think about how I could better contribute. During the ITN days, I made several new long-lasting friends in the SPO community. Mainnet launch approached with the switch from Rust to Haskell code base. I was invited to the Friends & Family group to be one of the first to iron out bugs and help with documentation to make the onboarding for the rest of the SPO community as painless as possible. I continued with the AHL (AHLNET) brand into the mainnet launch, which was the 15th first pool registration on the blockchain and has been running non-stop since. ### How did the Cardano Foundation delegation impact your stake pool operation? Marketing and social engagement have never been my thing even though I recognize that it's a crucial part of being a stake pool operator. Time is finite and I want to spend as much of it as possible contributing where I can do the most good, and that is on the tech. This is where the Cardano Foundation delegation program really helped. Right off the bat for the mainnet launch, I received a healthy boost to kickstart my pool for my contributions to the [SPO Guild Operators toolset](https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators). This helped to put AHL on the map and showed delegators how their stake contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem. I have since been selected for a couple more Cardano Foundation delegation rounds, and this has been crucial for me to keep a healthy saturation level for my devoted and loyal delegators who have stuck with me through thick and thin. Because of this and due to a very stable pool setup with redundancy failover scripts, I have been able to spend most of my time building useful tools instead. My goal has always been to be able to use the revenue from the Cardano stake pool operation to fund what I really love to do: build stuff. ### Did you find the Cardano Foundation delegation enabled you to build or improve your tools, projects, or open source repositories? During the ITN days, I got to know many other early pioneers in the Cardano SPO space. For example, I ran into Andrew behind the [BCSH stake pool](https://bluecheesestakehouse.com/), who created [Jormanager](https://bitbucket.org/muamw10/jormanager/src/develop/) to manage a cluster of Jormungandr (ITN node sw) nodes. To help fellow SPOs install this great tool, I created a bash installation script for Jormanager to guide and set up dependencies, configuration, and services needed. This was the start of my deep dive into the wonders of bash. When the ITN end was in sight and mainnet, with its new Haskell code base, started to take shape, I joined the [Guild Operators group](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators). A group of established figures in the space with a deep commitment to helping bring clarity and solutions to technical questions and issues. Under the Guild Ops umbrella, I helped develop many useful open source easy-to-use tools like [CNTools](https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/Scripts/cntools/), [gLiveView](https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/Scripts/gliveview/), and other utility scripts for the operation, monitoring, and management of a Cardano stake pool. The tools were ready in a stable state for the mainnet launch and helped many pool operators with a successful launch. Since then and to this day, this tool set has grown a lot with new features added to adapt to the evolving Cardano blockchain with additions of native tokens and much more. It's great to follow the adoption and how widespread these tools are today in the SPO community. Another pool operator I ran into during the ITN days and later again after mainnet launch, was Marcel running the [TITAN stake pool](https://www.titanstaking.io/). We both saw a need in the space for a Cardano wallet that could do more than was provided by the wallets at the time. Both Daedalus and Yoroi were too limited for our needs and had issues we felt we could solve. This became the start of a long friendship and collaboration with the launch of CCVault back in 2021. Since then, it has seen two rebrands due to name conflicts, with Eternl wallet now as the established and final brand. It's wonderful to see the recognition we have got in the space, with total transactions on the Cardano blockchain sent through Eternl going over 50% at times. The icing on the cake was the award received during the [Cardano Summit 2022](https://summit.cardano.org/archive/lausanne/) for [best wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb252CwjHOE) voted by the community. It fuels the team to work even harder to continue to innovate and provide the best wallet experience. While working on the Guild Ops tools and Eternl wallet, another missing piece was identified. A good API query layer to help builders on Cardano fetch the data they need to create applications on top of Cardano. A few from the Guild Ops group came together to solve this, and [Koios](https://koios.rest) was born, a distributed and [open source public API query layer](https://github.com/koios-official) for Cardano that is elastic in nature and provides an easy-to-query RESTful layer that has a lot of flexibility to cater to different data consumption requirements from the blockchain. To be able to spend the time needed on all these parallel ongoing projects, I stepped down to only working 50% at my non-blockchain day job at an air traffic control center here in Sweden. As you might expect, with a day job, running a stake pool, and participating in many different ongoing projects building on Cardano, the schedule is full, but I love it and wouldn't have it any other way.

Embracing blockchain, and specifically Cardano, means prioritizing transparency, security, and inclusivity while also empowering individuals and organizations to refine the financial, governance, and social systems of today. Adoption of new technologies often fosters innovation. The Foundation’s technical collaboration with Epoch Sports and Merchadise developed new standards for verifying and reinforcing a product’s authenticity. Similarly, the [Foundation and Switzerland for UNHCR collaboration](https://unrefugees.ch/en/blockchain-refugees) has already spanned a variety of initiatives with direct impact on-chain as well as on the support given to forcibly displaced people. ## A humanitarian approach to Cardano adoption Switzerland for UNHCR’s [With Refugees Stake Pool (WRFGS)](https://unrefugees.ch/en/blockchain-refugees) stake pool tests new models for philanthropy, providing donors with a reliable, auditable way of generating the possibility of continuous resources for humanitarian aid. Supported by Taurus, the \\[WRFGS] pool enables a large community of both tech-minded and traditional donors to help make a difference. As part of Cardano’s [second Global Impact Challenge](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/announcing-second-annual-global-impact-challenge-with-unhcr/), the charity stake pool launched with a stake delegation by the Cardano Foundation of 3.5 million ada, the native token of the Cardano blockchain. ![Let's Talk Cardano - Blockchain for Social Impact](https://ucarecdn.com/acb06343-e5e4-41f7-bb70-885dcc5e8c5a/ \"Let's Talk Cardano - Blockchain for Social Impact\") “Let’s Talk Cardano” returned on [World Refugee Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FP3Wsoi5Q8) for a webinar about the potential of NFTs for humanitarian aid. The panel, moderated by Dan Friedman (IOHK Business Development Manager), included Alex Maaza (Outreach Development Officer at the Cardano Foundation), John Valdez (GOAT Tribe CMO), Chadi Nassar (Plutus Art Co-Founder), and Ruxanda Cornescu (CH4UNHCR Representative). Sandro Knöpfel,  Head of Financial and Regulated Institutions at the Foundation, and Alvaro Cosi, Head of Communications and Innovation at UNHCR, also joined the [Sygnum Bank podcast](https://www.s-ge.com/en/article/news/2023-ip-blockchain-switzerland-i5-podcast?ct) early in the year to discuss how blockchain can help to solve humanitarian challenges. The Foundation has likewise facilitated introductions across the Cardano community, leading to multiple projects working in collaboration with the UN Refugee Agency’s Swiss partner to help the refugee cause. In February 2023, Maaza attended NFT Paris to hold meetings with Clay Nation, NMKR, and UNHCR. The following month, Switzerland for UNHCR [partnered with NMKR](https://www.nmkr.io/clients/unhcr-raises-funds-with-nfts-for-refugees) and TURF to launch a series of exclusive NFTs in support of forcibly displaced people. Soon after, Switzerland for UNHCR launched a second series of exclusive NFTs in support of forcibly displaced people—only available during Consensus 2023. HOSKY, the Cardano-based meme token, also [partnered with the [WRFGS]](https://medium.com/@admin_1263/hosky-to-partner-with-united-nations-refugee-agency-to-reward-those-raising-funds-for-refugees-1330bbbb1722) stake pool to assist UNHCR in addressing the most pressing needs of refugees. ![Switzerland for UNHCR](https://ucarecdn.com/4aa55431-f8e1-4497-9810-82aefe8cbdb3/ \"Switzerland for UNHCR\") Later in the year, Maaza and Jeremy Firster, Global Director of Enterprise Partnerships at the Foundation, joined GOAT Tribe for a [Twitter Space discussion](https://twitter.com/adaGOATS/status/1667178201364279297) on how NFTs can make a difference. Maaza also took part in the AdaGoats x Dramz Auction House [Twitter Space discussion](https://twitter.com/adaGOATS/status/1669819757833474052) on sustainability, the Cardano Global Initiative challenges, and the Foundation’s role in the ecosystem. In June, Italian artist Fabio Giampietro created an exclusive Art Basel 2023 NFT to support UNHCR’s relief operations in the field, with the NMKR Cardano project minting this [''Eternal Nexus'' collection](https://www.nmkr.io/unhcr-mint). Equally leveraging the possibilities of the Cardano blockchain, GOAT Tribe launched the [“Kind Hoofs”](https://www.kindhoofs.com/) initiative in the same month. These unique NFTs contributed to the \\[WRFGS] stake pool, further supporting the efforts of Switzerland for UNHCR. ## Powering Cardano adoption From art to fashion, and from merchandise to food products or medical supplies, blockchain can guarantee a permanent, verifiable register by creating immutable records of physical goods on-chain. In July 2023, the Foundation supported US-based sports brand, Epoch Sports, and the full-stack apparel ecosystem, Merchadise, to launch [6000 limited edition commemorative lacrosse jerseys](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/technical-collaboration-with-epoch-sports-merchadise/)—all authenticated on the Cardano blockchain and distributed during the 2023 World Lacrosse Men's Championship. A limited number of commemorative jerseys were also later available on the Official 2023 World Lacrosse Championship’s web store. ![Technical collaboration with Epoch Sports & Merchadise - 6000 NFTs minted](https://ucarecdn.com/cfc8b932-0458-410d-8227-e9afae5f79cf/ \"Technical collaboration with Epoch Sports & Merchadise - 6000 NFTs minted\") Simultaneously, the Foundation has increased its efforts to nurture the growth and maturity of Cardano’s open source ecosystem, promoting and contributing to open source initiatives such as [Aiken](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/aiken-the-future-of-smart-contracts/). In partnership with TxPipe and born from the collaboration of diverse contributors, Aiken simplifies and enhances smart contract development, providing a more user-friendly and efficient experience for developers. Specifically, Aiken utilizes a C-family syntax similar to Rust and Typescript, making it familiar and accessible. It also introduces features such as quick compiler feedback, automatic code formatting, and a comprehensive toolkit for working with Cardano smart contracts. Aiken highlights the potential of open source development and community collaboration—evolving from a conversation among engineers to an alpha release within a year. As Aiken enters its alpha phase, developers are encouraged to explore its capabilities through tutorials and contribute to its growth, with thorough audits planned to ensure enterprise-grade robustness. Beyond Aiken, the Foundation continues to work towards blockchain adoption on multiple fronts, releasing several [noteworthy products](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-foundation-2023-products-to-advance-blockchain) that will continue to evolve and contribute to the ecosystem. As we look towards the future, the Cardano Foundation wishes everyone a happy, festive season and a wonderful 2024.","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/e49ed24a-d174-41fa-8b54-6bf67bc15140/","default_content":"What does Cardano adoption look like?

In partnership with [Petrobras](https://petrobras.com.br/) , Brazil’s state-owned energy company, the Cardano Foundation will lead blockchain education workshops for Petrobras employees, with [Cardano Academy](https://academy.cardanofoundation.org/) content delivered via the Petrobras University. Participants will discuss blockchain’s potential, learn about the diverse use cases and applications of blockchain, and complete interactive quizzes on related topics. As part of the programme’s launch, the Cardano Foundation conducted two workshops in the Metaverse, one of which delved into regulatory matters on a global scale as well as in the Brazilian context. The Cardano Academy is a comprehensive blockchain education programme, developed by the Cardano Foundation, providing a reliable resource for those interested in learning more about blockchain’s potential. Academy content will be tailored by Petrobras for use in its employee training programmes, which is accessible to Petrobras’s more than 40,000 employees; the employees will also receive a certificate of their blockchain training upon completion of the course. The first 500 Petrobras participants of the Cardano Academy will also receive an NFT which will be minted for the  500 participants, in partnership with the Petrobras Education Board. The NFT will evolve with the participants’ progress in the training to track and highlight their achievements. The Cardano Foundation expects its partnership with Petrobras will mark the first of many new initiatives to enhance understanding of blockchain through employee education and, ultimately, drive exploration of new use cases for the technology in the energy sector. Commenting on the partnership, Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard said:  “Empowerment through education is a central part of our mission at the Cardano Foundation. That goal includes working across all stakeholders in society to achieve blockchain literacy, from individuals to enterprise. Our partnership with Petrobras—a Fortune 500 company and one of the largest public companies in the world—highlights both the appetite from enterprise for blockchain education as well as the growing reach of the Cardano Foundation and its mission. We are excited to partner with Petrobras and look forward to working with them, both to educate and to explore new use cases for blockchain technology.” Petrobras stated: “This bold new partnership with the Cardano Foundation represents an important step forward in our mission to harness the power of blockchain for new use cases within the energy sector. Education will play a key role in this and is therefore at the core of this innovative new partnership.”"},"name":"cardano-foundation-announces-education-partnership-with-petrobras-1.md","sha":"5d13755f9e63bc3d7b565e33d8faaccd99732458","resource_href":"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-foundation-announces-education-partnership-with-petrobras-1/"},{"title":"Cardano Foundation 2023 Products to Advance Blockchain","language":"en","banner_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/0e3d90c6-b6a4-41c2-992a-75ccdb1b984c/","meta_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/bbfb7bff-8e42-4597-b6f1-fd4ac8745c79/","thumbnail_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/69d99966-c0aa-4d49-8409-67725062c5b7/","layout":"news","news_item_content":{"show_excerpt":"true","date":"2023-12-14T17:19:58.884Z","author":"https://ucarecdn.com/59bdc3b9-7337-4a20-b348-475adbe2a676/| Alex Apeldoorn~~~Director of Products","body":"With year-end fast approaching, this is the opportune time to reflect on the successes of 2023 while preparing for what will come in 2024. The [Cardano Summit](https://summit.cardano.org/) certainly galvanized not just community support but also interest across different industries. However, the Summit stands as just one of the many activities and projects carried out by the various Cardano Foundation teams. Even in these final months of 2023, we have several exciting updates to share. The Foundation has released a suite of tools that improve the building experience on Cardano, including [Ledger Sync](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/accessing-cardano-blockchain-data-with-ledger-sync/) and the [Identity Wallet](https://identity.cardanofoundation.org/).  On the one hand, these address developer and business needs alike, further facilitating the adoption of Cardano for the social and financial systems of tomorrow. On the other, as open source tools, they invite community feedback as well as participation, and we heartily welcome all those interested in contributing. Similarly, both the [Cardano Explorer](https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/en/) built by the Foundation and the [Cardano Academy](https://academy.cardanofoundation.org/) have a transparency component, serving to deliver formal education and increase knowledge about Cardano and its design decisions. ## Improving Operational Resilience and Adoption The Cardano Foundation has long emphasized the importance of accessibility, which in turn makes it easier for everyone to build on Cardano. Earlier this year, we published a [report of our activities](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/annual-report/), outlining a strategy that encompasses three core focus areas: operational resilience, education, and adoption. While many ways exist to nurture these focus areas, the Foundation believes that open source is crucial to all efforts, serving as an enablement vehicle. Indeed, the tools we develop can determine how quickly the community benefits from accessibility. We therefore guide our work by an emphasis on key initiatives. To begin with, the Foundation understands the importance of attracting start-up-driven innovation, which first and foremost means streamlining the onboarding process. For instance, projects like [Aiken](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/aiken-the-future-of-smart-contracts/), [Kupo](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo#readme), and [Ogmios](https://ogmios.dev/) have dramatically reduced the time and cost required to build on Cardano. Creating these tools with language-agnostic interfaces also comes as a strategic move as they employ widely known technologies common to those familiar with web development. Likewise, these projects focus heavily on user experience and are fully open sourced solutions. In addition, the Foundation aims to attract businesses and organizations to Cardano that can derive value from blockchain-based solutions. Given Java remains the predominant language for enterprise developers, offering tools and services in this language is an intentional effort to support adoption. Notably, the Foundation has created Ledger Sync and the Identity Wallet in Java to reduce the associated onboarding time. Ledger Sync provides a Java tool that puts sequential blockchain data in a new, more swiftly accessible database structure, while the Identity Wallet offers a [W3C-compatible](https://www.w3.org/) mobile wallet that manages self-sovereign identities across Cardano and other blockchain networks. ![Cardano Foundation Identity Wallet](https://ucarecdn.com/44c038a9-c894-46ee-ad70-8e2a0e23a661/ \"Cardano Foundation Identity Wallet\") The wallet is designed to support multiple identity and credential standards, integrating key event receipt infrastructure (KERI) for enhanced interoperability which can benefit a wide range of future use cases and enterprise-level solutions. Both the wallet and Ledger Sync are open source tools, and the development team invites contributions from the community and businesses joining the ecosystem. ![Cardano Track and Trace Solution](https://ucarecdn.com/ac63ab99-a3b1-46ca-a850-0501befc5bd5/ \"Cardano Track and Trace Solution\") In line with the open source ethos, the Foundation leveraged Ledger Sync and the Identity Wallet to further deliver the [Bolnisi track and trace solution](https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/en/transaction/b8e1b4005d872a9d3c2cc77008ee6b53f730c8990f09e421af6060f7a79408ae/metadata) in partnership with [Scantrust](https://www.scantrust.com/). The Bolnisi winemakers have already anchored 100,000 bottles of wine on the Cardano blockchain. In fact, this initiative marks a significant milestone in using Web3 technology to validate proof of origin and product authenticity, both welcome improvements in the fight against counterfeit goods worldwide that affects multiple industries. The fashion industry, for example, loses billions annually from counterfeit products, not to mention the reputational damage that can result from fake products. With this in mind, the [Cardano Foundation and Merchadise collaboration](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/technical-collaboration-with-epoch-sports-merchadise/) takes a new approach to licensed intellectual property. NFC chips linked to on-chain records on the Cardano blockchain prove the authenticity of a series of Commemorative Jerseys while simultaneously detailing their characteristics and increasing consumer engagement. ## Bolstering Education on Cardano Regardless of the specific use case, enabling a diverse group of businesses to build on Cardano stands as a critical catalyst for improving the adoption and operational resilience of the network. For this to happen, however, businesses as well as individuals need a good understanding of the technology’s potential. Blockchain education plays a key role here. The Foundation has therefore undertaken several education-related initiatives. The recently [open sourced rewards calculation](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/releasing-an-open-source-rewards-calculation/) brings the calculation to a broader audience. It not only allows independent auditing of the rewards’ execution but crucially supports education about Cardano’s treasury system, leading to a more transparent process. In the same vein of transparency, the Cardano Foundation often works with regulators and auditors to exhibit nuances of the proof of stake (PoS) implementation and how this consensus mechanism impacts end users. Indeed, the Cardano Explorer has become pivotal in explaining how Cardano's public infrastructure works. We have frequently received positive feedback from regulators and auditors, highlighting how the explorer makes blockchain more accessible. ![Cardano Explorer](https://ucarecdn.com/b8b266c3-3c3b-48a4-88ee-d2adf33cd912/ \"Cardano Explorer\") To further improve accessibility, the explorer will continue to enhance visualization for the design decisions and on-chain transactions made on Cardano. In fact, the most recent update contains a new smart contract visualization user interface (UI). Moreover, our teams are already working towards a Voltaire visualization, and we will likewise open source the explorer in the near future. Anyone interested can read the explorer’s [latest release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-explorer/releases/tag/v0.5.0). In keeping with our mandate to promote decentralized technologies, the Foundation also regularly experiments and tests the capabilities of different options at the vanguard of technology. As such, the [Cardano Academy](https://academy.cardanofoundation.org/) brought in-house subject matter experts and generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools together to create the new batch of educational material. After the launching of the Alpha Program in the early months of 2023, the Academy will now offer the full units of the Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate (CBCA) course. The in-depth content will introduce students to basic concepts and progressively grow their knowledge so they can develop a wider awareness of various blockchain topics. We hope the course will both promote inclusivity in the blockchain space and foster a deeper awareness of blockchain technology. ![Cardano Academy](https://ucarecdn.com/c3ef6c92-7c6f-46d6-afc0-a2e55fd3b44d/ \"Cardano Academy\") Overall, supporting the visualization of complex technologies, topics, and decisions creates an easier, friendly experience that welcomes a wider audience, simultaneously enabling and prompting more people to join the Cardano ecosystem. In fact, accessible tools and educational materials go hand in hand. Together, they result in more diverse contributions, stronger decentralized governance, and more innovative ideas. In 2024 the Cardano Foundation will improve and expand upon the product portfolio’s capability while listening to feedback in our open source channels. Additionally, we will continue to play an active role in the Voltaire governance era, expand on ways to apply AI to the Academy, and contribute to the new KERI standard, championing this initiative with both partners and the community. Regardless of the product, the Foundation welcomes all willing contributors as we look forward to a fantastic 2024 journey alongside the entire Cardano ecosystem.","cat":"all","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/14a0859a-d306-4668-a9b9-2a00ee4a9244/","default_content":"The Foundation has released a suite of tools that improve the building experience on Cardano, including Ledger Sync and the Identity Wallet."},"name":"cardano-foundation-2023-products-to-advance-blockchain.md","sha":"9f7283f2e35ed689446cb83f58e02e727a59f315","resource_href":"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-foundation-2023-products-to-advance-blockchain/"},{"title":"Driving Blockchain Technology: Cardano Foundation’s activities part 5","language":"en","banner_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/dd0ed52b-65be-4165-9dce-7eb30d9dd79d/","meta_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/7b06dfad-a398-4035-a92e-0a559ce7aa05/","thumbnail_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/dd0ed52b-65be-4165-9dce-7eb30d9dd79d/","layout":"news","news_item_content":{"show_excerpt":"true","date":"2023-12-13T17:35:36.476Z","author":"https://ucarecdn.com/d91681b5-17a1-499b-910a-766ef7ac525d/-/crop/1756x2321/0,0/-/preview/|David Taylor~~~Chief Marketing Officer","body":"A good understanding of blockchain technology empowers individuals, developers, and organizations to harness its unique capabilities. It also enables them to build, as well as contribute to, the ecosystem with confidence. Informed users are more likely to embrace the potential of scalable, decentralized infrastructure and apply it to a wider range of use cases. The Cardano Foundation, therefore, not only supports research efforts but also constantly promotes and participates in educational activities that help explain blockchain and decentralization to various stakeholders. Early in 2023, CEO Frederik Gregaard provided a [detailed explanation of the Foundation’s core focus areas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89d8t72C4Uk) of operational resilience, education, and adoption. Our inaugural [Annual Report](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/annual-report/) later delved into the Foundation’s activities during 2022, and an April masterclass and evening networking [event in London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6EtT2SFcbE) offered a unique opportunity to dive into the ways blockchain addresses the needs of the financial industry. ## Education in the realm of regulation Regulation is essential to blockchain education and can provide a clear framework to help legitimize the technology. Specifically, regulatory understanding helps protect investors and users, fostering trust and confidence in blockchain innovations while deterring fraudulent or malicious activities. Precisely for this reason, when responding to public consultation, including the [Financial Stability Board's one on its stablecoin and crypto-asset activity recommendations](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/taking-a-nuanced-approach-to-digital-asset-regulation/), the Foundation advocates for an adequate, risk-based legal and regulatory framework that takes into consideration the vast spectrum of current, as well as potential blockchain use cases. In October 2022, Gregaard traveled to Brussels for a fireside chat at the [Blockchain for Europe Summit 2022](https://www.blockchain4europe.eu/event/blockchain-for-europe-summit-2022/), titled “From open source to open governance.” The summit brought together representatives from multiple EU institutions that shape the blockchain sector, including academic and industry stakeholders. Notably, the two-day conference covered topics like the impact of [MiCA and TFR](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230414IPR80133/crypto-assets-green-light-to-new-rules-for-tracing-transfers-in-the-eu) on the industry, tokenized economy, Digital Euro, stablecoins, DeFi, data and blockchain, smart contracts and AI, and more. Building on the momentum of this event, Gregaard appeared before the [All-Party Parliamentary Group on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)](https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/APPG/central-bank-and-digital-currency) to discuss government-issued stablecoins. Soon after, he spoke with [BeInCrypto](https://beincrypto.com/privacy-problem-cbdcs-says-cardano-foundation-ceo/) about the blockchain ecosystem and opportunities for digital assets in the country. During this discussion, Gregaard highlighted how the current debate around CBDCs primarily focuses on privacy and expressed regret that the conversation often stalls on the retail use of digital cash. Since this discussion, Gregaard has elaborated on the potential of a digital euro, suggesting it could redefine inclusivity, efficiency, and transparency in the European Union economy. In support of this stance, Gregaard penned an [op-ed for CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/09/how-to-level-the-global-financial-system/), which examined the need for a revolutionary spirit and regulatory awareness when aiming to replace incumbent bank technology. The op-ed stressed how blockchain acts as a vehicle for radical transparency, giving power to identity and new forms of governance. In fact, decentralized networks empower people to participate in and shape a more equitable and inclusive digital future. Delving deeper into the regulatory discussion, Gregaard wrote an [op-ed for CityAM](https://www.cityam.com/why-we-must-engage-with-policymakers-on-the-importance-of-crypto-blockchain-and-defi-for-the-future-of-finance/), discussing the importance of engaging with policymakers and how recent actions of UK regulators could provide a true agenda-setting approach. In the article, he highlighted the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) and its ability to transform traditional financial services by eliminating intermediaries and reducing transaction costs. Gregaard reinforced this sentiment in [responding to SEC filings](https://x.com/Cardano_CF/status/1666128229952897024?s=20) against Coinbase and Binance thereafter. This decentralized ethos also appeared prominently in the [CV VC Top 50 Report](https://www.cvvc.com/insights#top50), which featured Cardano as a leading entity. The report included an expert article from Gregaard, who wrote about the Foundation’s partnership with Georgia’s National Wine Agency—an organization that aims to bolster the country's reputation as a premium wine producer using the Cardano blockchain. The collaboration leverages blockchain's permanent, immutable, and verifiable nature to deliver a scalable, cost-effective method of ensuring the authenticity of Georgian wine. The Foundation is also tapping this unique blockchain functionality in collaboration with Switzerland for UNHCR, supporting several humanitarian initiatives. Gregaard equally attended the CV VC Top 50 Report Launch Dinner during the World Economic Forum in Davos and participated in the “Blockchain for Good” panel. After this event, as part of the [Financial Times' Crypto and Digital Assets Summit](https://crypto.live.ft.com/agenda/session/1034242) in London, Gregaard joined Levan Davitashvili, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy of Georgia, in the panel \"Building resilience with blockchain - can the use of blockchains curtail global disruption?\". In addition, Francis Bignell of the Fintech Times interviewed Gregaard to discuss how the Cardano proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, Ouroboros, improves the security guarantees of proof of work (PoW) at a fraction of the cost. Gregaard also took this opportunity to highlight the Foundation’s [first Global Impact Challenge](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/blockchain-reforestation-with-veritree-a-model-for-environmental-practices/) with veritree, an organization that provides climate solutions via blockchain-verified tree planting. With a focus on emerging use cases, Gregaard later joined an [X (formerly known as Twitter) space with Nucast](https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF/status/1630537613730775040), a digital media ownership and content streaming platform on the Cardano blockchain. The discussion focused on the [Nucast Film Festival](https://app.nucast.io/fest), the first event of its kind on the Cardano blockchain. ## Building bridges across communities In addition to Gregaard’s education-related efforts, several other Cardano Foundation members participated in various discussions and community events across a wide range of topics. For instance, Sandro Knöpfel, Head of Financial Institutions, spoke at [Building Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T49jTPsFMd0&t=28s), where [Cardashift](https://www.cardashift.com/) and [World Mobile](https://worldmobile.io/en) were present. During the event, Knöpfel delivered a session titled \"Beyond the Hype: Blockchain Infrastructure and Communities for the Global Goals.\" Knöpfel also took part via [a live stream recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7YCUDVWn2A) in the launching of Sri Lanka’s first NFT project with Coin Ceylon. Alongside this stream, national news featured the Cardano Foundation speaking at the [Yakka Art event](https://www.yakka.art/live/) attended by government officials and organizations from the Colombo district. Sebastian Bode, Director of Engineering, examined the current and future of Layer-1 platforms in The Block’s panel discussion \"[Comparing Layer-1 Platforms: 2022 Edition Recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfA7rldHIU4).\" Bode also spoke with [Bitrue](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1yNGaNdlWlQJj) about the Cardano blockchain’s unique characteristics, as well as the Foundation’s role in advancing the network, later giving the opening talk at an educational session on the Web3Learn platform. The session, “[Intro to Cardano Ecosystem & Opportunities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbcVjBAXuX0&t=192s),” reviewed Cardano for developers, including the first steps for developers in the Cardano ecosystem, and discussed Cardano’s grant opportunities via Project Catalyst. A small group of Cardano Foundation representatives attended the [Meta Monzón: II Blockchain and DeFi Congress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POeZjJEjYGc) in Spain. During the event, Knöpfel participated in the \"Smart Regulation and Misconceptions Across Markets\" panel, while Jide Fashola, Head of Technical Integrations, joined the \"[Enterprise Use Cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nORW0sYgAEE)\" panel, and Gregaard delivered a keynote addressing the specificities of \"Protocols for the future of public administration and applications for the private sector.” Additionally, the Foundation had a booth at the [Crypto Valley Conference](https://www.cryptovalleyconference.com/), with multiple people from across the Foundation present. Knöpfel delivered a masterclass on \"[Upgrading the Systems of the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc-ZwMZSm8E)\" while Gregaard led a session titled \"[Enterprise Blockchain is Dead...Long live Blockchain for Enterprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50LJD-DSXIY&list=PL2RguVq4YcL2nQJ3gO5gSxeLPEiq-IN8h&index=36)\". As a further effort to equip the community and stir conversations, the Foundation launched a new series of webinars titled “Let’s Talk Cardano.” The first focused on the Women of Cardano, featuring three panels: Businesses Building on Cardano, Cardano NFTs (cNFTs), and [Women in Catalyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTGEIN5-wlA). Later [episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy5fgLxZhmM) discussed the ways blockchain can create [positive social impact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FP3Wsoi5Q8), and equally gave the Cardano community an opportunity to [ask questions to our CEO, Frederik Gregaard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlxMaD7VGz0). The Cardano Foundation has long championed the multiple aspects of education, from fostering regulatory clarity or supporting blockchain research to providing reliable information. The [Cardano Academy](https://academy.cardanofoundation.org/), which had its Alpha Program launched early in the year, comes as another aspect of this commitment. Receiving such positive feedback for the Alpha Program and winning the [People’s Choice Award at Paris Blockchain Week](https://www.parisblockchainweek.com/press/paris-blockchain-week-announces-star-studded-list-of-nominees-for-the-inaugural-edition-of-the-paris-blockchain-week-awards) has not only overjoyed the teams at the Foundation, but indeed reinforced our motivation to continuously strive to do more and better. The Foundation encourages anyone with questions or comments to reach out to us via any of our channels.","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/dd0ed52b-65be-4165-9dce-7eb30d9dd79d/","default_content":"A good understanding of blockchain technology empowers individuals, developers, and organizations to harness its unique capabilities."},"name":"driving-blockchain-technology-cardano-foundations-activities-part.md","sha":"e9563edd21d53085440b0a94f29e63fda739b25e","resource_href":"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/driving-blockchain-technology-cardano-foundations-activities-part/"},{"title":"Cardano Ballot 2023: The Voice of the Cardano Community","language":"en","banner_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/d32804d0-5531-4879-aae7-e2670c9a49e9/","meta_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/ddd1484b-2a1b-40b7-a949-e0d03d464674/","thumbnail_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/50c02c7f-ac7a-414b-97ff-0bc214462f3e/","layout":"news","news_item_content":{"show_excerpt":"true","date":"2023-12-05T17:35:36.476Z","body":"The ability to cast a ballot and have your vote counted is essential to any fair election. Ideally, this process should be accurate and transparent, verifiable yet secure, and accessible to all. In 2022, the [first Cardano Ballot](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/the-cardano-ballot-developing-a-decentralized-voting-app/) iteration occurred in collaboration with [SundaeSwap](https://sundae.fi/products/governance)—a partnership established to support voting for the Cardano Summit Awards and Day 2 speaker. Again this year, [Awards voting for the Cardano Summit 2023](https://voting.summit.cardano.org/) took place using the Cardano Ballot. Ongoing public debates surrounding various elections around the world have highlighted the need for improvements and continuous increased confidence surrounding ballot issuance, processing, and vote tallying procedures. Given the Cardano Foundation’s fundamental understanding of these common challenges, we set about providing a solution by way of the 2023 Cardano Ballot while simultaneously endeavoring to enhance the Ballot’s previous iteration. ## Improving Cardano Ballot Over the last 12 months, the Cardano Ballot has evolved significantly into a modular, [open source repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot) featuring independent backend services that can be coupled with bespoke user interfaces—thus enabling a truly custom blockchain-based voting solution. As a result, the Ballot continues to provide free, user-based voting, but it is now also possible to leverage it for stake-based voting events. The Cardano Ballot’s staked-based voting requires participants to have staked ada before a predefined snapshot of the Cardano blockchain. This snapshot determines the weighted amount of each participant's vote within a specific Cardano Ballot event. Also, due to the new backend service [voting-admin-app](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot/tree/main/backend-services/voting-admin-app), Cardano Ballot events are now registered publicly on-chain. This new on-chain registration process ensures transparency and serves as an immutable record for all Cardano Ballot voting events. In addition to these enhancements, among many others, we at the Foundation would like to happily announce that the Cardano Ballot is now [open source](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot). ## Cardano Ballot Journey and Outlook In 2022, the Ballot laid the foundation not just for a free and user-based [voting application](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/the-cardano-ballot-developing-a-decentralized-voting-app/), but an anonymous one that is transparent, verifiable, and secure. However, following the Cardano Summit 2022, we identified a number of enhancements worth considering. For instance, the open source [cardano-connect-with-wallet](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-connect-with-wallet) component developed by the Foundation and featured in the Ballot last year constitutes one such improvement. Throughout 2023, this component has evolved from a React-specific one into a framework-independent library. The driving idea for the component has always been to simplify the integration of Cardano wallets with Cardano decentralized applications (DApps). Limited mobile wallet support already existed for last year’s Cardano Ballot, but the team wished to extend it further. This spurred us to ideate over possible alternatives for communications between DApps and existing wallets. As a result, the [Decentralized WebRTC DApp-Wallet Communication](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/395), or [CIP-45](https://github.com/fabianbormann/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-%3F%3F%3F%3F/README.md), now provides a standard for decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) communications between wallets and DApps on Cardano. CIP-45 utilizes the well-established WebRTC protocol coupled with WebTorrent trackers to enable a truly decentralized peer discovery method that is both privacy-preserving and reliable. The 2023 Ballot demonstrated the CIP-45 application, whereby users could utilize [Eternl’s CIP-45 implementation](https://beta.eternl.io/app/mainnet/welcome) to connect P2P with the Cardano Ballot. The Ballot exhibited further innovation this year, supporting the Cardano Summit 2023 Awards voting with the first-ever Hydra Tally. The team expressed a desire to explore [Hydra](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/hydra-head-protocol-an-open-source-solution-for-scalability/) following last year’s Summit. Moreover, we wanted to further enhance transparency, scalability, and auditability. To achieve these enhancements, we leveraged [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) smart contracts and [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/) to enable on-chain validation of the voting results tally. The public can now [inspect the smart contract data](https://cardanoscan.io/datumInspector?datum=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) and easily confirm whether the results were tallied correctly for each Cardano Summit 2023 Award category. ## Evolving Applications of Cardano Ballot Earlier this year, the Cardano Foundation received a request from [IOG](https://iohk.io/) to support CIP-1694 pre-ratification events by way of the Cardano Ballot. IOG had previously made an evaluation of voting solutions on Cardano, including a review of Voteaire and SundaeSwap Governance, and decided to opt for the Foundation’s voting solution. This request to support CIP-1694 pre-ratification events established a new requirement for stake-based voting, prompting the Foundation’s team to develop the necessary functionality. The weight assigned to each ballot stands as the key difference between user and stake-based voting. Stake-based voting requires the calculation of a weighted amount for each ballot based on the amount of ada staked by an address at a given time. This time is captured using a snapshot of the Cardano blockchain and must occur before the Cardano Ballot event commences. The specifics of each Cardano Ballot event appear [detailed on-chain](https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/en/transaction/992c3930ac015e11c174afc89e4868b640d3503531d2f834be6b1a9e6033d7b8/metadata). In fact, this aspect is part of the new registration process mentioned previously. ## Cardano Ballot Technical Insights The Ballot’s open sourced, modularized repository with the [backend-services](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot/tree/main/backend-services) includes six applications: Admin, Voting, Commitment, Ledger Follower, Verification, and Hydra Tally. The team designed these modular applications to be lightweight and decentralized.  For example, the [voting-verification-app](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot/tree/main/backend-services/voting-verification-app) provides an independent application meant for the community, voters, and third parties to verify on-chain Cardano Ballot vote proofs. Many backend services, including the verification app, are configured using the Cardano Ballot event registration metadata on-chain. In keeping with its previous version, the Cardano Ballot currently supports two user verification methods: SMS and Discord Bot. For the [Cardano Summit](https://summit.cardano.org/), SMS verification leveraged multi-factor authentication (MFA) best practices, and the Ballot specifically only stored a hash value for the phone number. The Discord Bot, developed last year for the Cardano Summit 2022, supported participants who did not want to provide a phone number to vote. The Cardano Foundation [discord-wallet-verification-bot](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-discord-wallet-verification-bot) has since evolved into an open source library designed for Cardano developers. This year, the user experience has also improved considerably: Users only have to perform the single action of clicking a button within Discord to verify their account with the Cardano Ballot. When configured to a Cardano Ballot event, the [Ledger Follower App](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot/tree/main/backend-services/voting-ledger-follower-app) will fetch all event-related data from the Cardano blockchain, including stake amounts for stake-based Cardano Ballot events. In addition to the modularized backend services, the Ballot implements Authenticated Web3 HTTP Requests, or [CIP-93](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip93/). This new approach provides an authentication method for user requests to DApp servers leveraging the Cardano blockchain and [CIP-08 Message Signing](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0008). ## Next for Cardano Ballot The newly open sourced Cardano Ballot repository provides developers with reference implementations for two complete Cardano Ballot events: [Cardano Summit 2023](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot/tree/main/ui/summit-2023) (user-based) and [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot/tree/main/ui/cip-1694) (stake-based). Each event utilizes the Cardano Ballot backend services with their respective frontends contained within the [UI directory](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot/tree/main/ui).  With the Ballot now open sourced, we hope the developer ecosystem will benefit from our journey over the last two years. But, most importantly, we hope the Cardano Ballot will continue to evolve in collaboration with the community. The Foundation would encourage those interested to review [BloxBean Cardano Projects](https://github.com/bloxbean), as our team benefited greatly from BloxBean’s [Yaci Store](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-store) and [DevKit](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-devkit) when developing the Ballot. We are thankful for their work, and we would indeed feel remiss if we did not mention them. In 2024, the Cardano Ballot will no longer require Cardano stake addresses to identify users. Instead, and if they so wish, users will have the possibility of utilizing mobile digital identity wallets to interact with the Ballot. This functionality will provide an innovative solution and reference implementation for identity management on the Cardano network. We also intend to continue our discovery with Hydra and further explore scalability, with an emphasis on verification and decentralized data storage solutions for cryptographic proofs. We have consciously not planned the complete 2024 Cardano Ballot roadmap as we want to remain flexible given any potential collaborations or requests from the community. Regardless of the use case, enhanced Cardano Ballot functionality benefits Web 2 developers looking to understand voting DApps, as well as experienced Cardano developers aiming to orchestrate their own Cardano Ballot user or stake-based event. Similarly, the Cardano Foundation intends the Ballot repository to empower Cardano ecosystem participants, delivering a robust methodology to cast a ballot and have any person’s vote counted.","cat":"all","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/1c935d0d-8bc5-410a-b347-6b0ad423bf16/","author":"https://ucarecdn.com/52383740-6543-4334-b896-2cd99f4c3dce/|Thomas A.

[Empowa](https://empowa.io/summit/) developed this year’s collection, which showcases the theme of “Blockchain for Social Impact” and is now [available to mint](https://empowa.io/summit/). The 2023 Summit collection features 30 unique digital collectibles representing six global regions—Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America, and South America—plus the five Cardano protocol phases—Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. NFTs come in packs of five, with the potential to mint duplicates in each pack. Funds raised will go towards building affordable, climate-resilient homes in Africa. [NMKR](https://www.nmkr.io/) supports the NFTs’ minting while waiving all transaction costs to maximize contributions to the cause. ## NFTs for Affordable Housing A blockchain-based RealFi project built on Cardano, Empowa operates across the African continent. Their pilot project started in Beira, Mozambique, and they work with local developers across the continent to provide rent-to-own financing for cost-effective housing. This approach gives families an affordable way to acquire a home with reliable electricity, running water, and sanitary ablution facilities. The benefits of living in properly built housing can not only improve health but also education outcomes. The Cardano Summit 2023 NFT collection will sponsor the construction of affordable, climate-conscious houses. Those interested can mint the NFTs in packs of five. So far, the collection has seen more than 8,300 NFTs minted. Upon collecting all 30 unique NFTs within one wallet, holders have a **Full Collection**.

Ledger Sync aims to achieve the same level of data completeness as [Cardano DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync)—also referred to as db-sync—while supplying an option in a programming language well-established among diverse companies as well as within a broad user base. In line with the Foundation’s efforts to foster Cardano’s open source maturity, the framework will be released under an open source license to equip developers and partners with an additional tool for chain indexing, increasing the diversity of the Cardano developer ecosystem. The Foundation has chosen to publish the [repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync) under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), which allows the use of the framework in commercial and non-commercial applications as well as in other open source tools. The license also provides legal certainty in the form of patent rights for tools built on or with it, plus for changes to the framework itself that need pointing out but not necessarily a public disclosure. This arrangement ensures optimal accessibility and legal certainty for companies as well as other developers and community members. ## Blockchain as a data structure Many blockchain-based systems face a common challenge: data cannot be efficiently retrieved in a random access way because of the storage’s organization in the format of a linked list. For instance, to access the transactions stored in block number 200 on Cardano, an application would have to iterate over the first 199 blocks before reaching the block that contains the desired information. If a blockchain network continuously expands, this approach becomes infeasible. Cardano, for instance, currently has more than 9.5 million blocks minted on mainnet. The fact that certain information is not explicitly stored on the blockchain presents yet another challenge. Due to Cardano’s [EUTxO](https://aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/eutxo)-based accounting model, this applies even to the current or historical balance of a wallet. In order to know the unspent transaction outputs (UTxOs) in a wallet, it would become necessary to track all UTxOs that have gone into and out of the wallet, then aggregate them to determine the final balance. Until roughly the beginning of 2022, db-sync had been the only available option for builders in the ecosystem to access data from the Cardano blockchain in an efficient way. However, in order to reach the tip of the chain, db-sync also requires the processing of an immense amount of data during the initial sync. This makes it infeasible to run db-sync for all projects. Additionally, in many cases projects do not need all the data provided by db-sync, a reality that led to the development of so-called scoped chain-indexers, allowing users to specify precisely which data needs to be indexed and made available for a certain application. Projects like [Kupo](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo#readme), [Scrolls](https://github.com/txpipe/scrolls#readme), [Oura](https://github.com/txpipe/oura), and [Carp](https://github.com/dcSpark/carp) all furnish the community with different ways of doing so. On top of those more technical requirements, businesses also frequently have needs regarding the reliability of such data provisioning services. Generally, these requirements relate not to the actual implementation in source code but to how such a system is operated. The Cardano Foundation developed Ledger Sync to address precisely those kinds of business requirements. While on the one hand it shares some similarities with db-sync, certain design choices make it a better fit for distributed architectures as they allow for high availability setups. In fact, the Foundation’s new [explorer](https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/en/) has already put Ledger Sync to use as its underlying data pipeline. If projects require very specific data from the Cardano blockchain but can forgo features like in-built high availability and offloading of data consolidation, modular chain indexers like yaci-store, scrolls, and Kupo present suitable choices. Ledger Sync, on the other hand, equips projects with a reliable option for a Java-based data layer on top of Cardano, especially when projects need dependable access to blockchain-related data based on a framework built in an easily accessible programming language. The initial design of Ledger Sync aimed to achieve three goals: 1. Implement the network mini protocols in Java so that network data is accessible in a way native to the Java programming-language without dependencies on other frameworks. 2. Decouple the pure crawling and data consolidation steps to enable [scale-out architectures](https://www.ibm.com/blog/cloud-scalability-scale-up-vs-scale-out/), meaning that parts of the computation can be offloaded to multiple instances, such as containers or servers, with the consequent evaluation of the negative impact inherited from transferring data via a network instead of keeping it locally in a single server. 3. Implement a node-independent version of the treasury, reserves, and [rewards calculation](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/releasing-an-open-source-rewards-calculation/), which the Foundation already recently open sourced. The original implementation that went live with the beta version of the Foundation’s explorer covered the first two points. The Foundation’s Engineering Team is currently working on the third point as part of another [open source project](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-java-rewards-calculation). ## Journey to the Ledger Sync repository The team reached a number of learnings during the first development phase, all already tackled in the version now released under an open source license. We started developing the network mini protocols in Java from scratch because, at the time the project began, the well-known [Yaci library](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci) was not yet available in a state we deemed usable. Nonetheless, we replaced the previous network mini protocol implementation with Yaci in the current version to help push the adoption of this community project. The change means that only one Java tech stack needs to be maintained and kept up-to-date with any changes to the protocol. For coordinating tasks between different services—like decoupling the crawling from the downstream processing and data consolidation—, the team initially used [Redis](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), a widely known open source streaming data platform. While this approach proves effective and Kafka, as well as Redis provide robust components in a distributed architecture, the deployments are quite costly and can become cumbersome, especially for smaller scale setups. With the latest release, the team replaced the necessity for Kafka and made it optional. Although Ledger Sync operates without Kafka, developers can use an in-app event mechanism made available by [Yaci Store](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-store) and opt to publish block data to various messaging platforms, such as Kafka and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), then consume it from another application. We also initially started with the same database schema used by db-sync. This approach proved useful while developing the Foundation’s explorer in parallel as it enabled the explorer backend to use real data for testing. However, it also resulted in design challenges for Ledger Sync as we deviated from the [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) approach and did not create a built-to-purpose schema for the first Ledger Sync version. While the database schema of db-sync serves its purpose, it does not support the chosen architecture and aim for parallelization during the data processing of Ledger Sync. We are therefore currently working on designing a new schema to replace the present one. Furthermore, the majority of recent source code additions include support for the [Conway era](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/projects/4) in Yaci. This update enables Ledger Sync, as well as all other Java-based tools to work with the latest ledger and network mini protocol version. The Foundation’s Engineering Team also started a workstream to implement parallel processing of multiple blocks, plus transactions in single blocks during the initial sync process. Parallelizing those computations is not straightforward as it becomes necessary to take into account dependencies between UTxOs, consequently decreasing the performance gained from the parallelization. Additionally, ongoing development efforts include offering blueprints for hosting Ledger Sync in various deployment scenarios, like in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) based setups or simply via docker-compose. ## The road ahead Besides its technical features, Ledger Sync comes with a commitment from the Cardano Foundation to provide continuous maintenance, plus operation of the repository as an open source project. Other than the framework as a library and tool itself, this effort aims at working with community groups, looking to define a standard and potential reference implementation for decentralized data APIs where Ledger Sync might be used as the underlying data layer. Delivering a hosted data API that guarantees high availability, accuracy, and correctness with a professional support model stands as an additional goal. Guaranteeing this would address the needs of organizations and enterprises, making it easier for them to seamlessly implement blockchain solutions and thus fostering greater enterprise adoption. Such an undertaking, however, requires alignment and collaboration with existing projects. Only by doing so does it become possible to leverage the full capacity of the already existing Cardano ecosystem while simultaneously ensuring an approach that supports the diversity of emerging business models. The Cardano Foundation encourages everyone to try Ledger Sync and engage with our team either via [Discord](https://discord.gg/6NA7jHjded) or by filing a feature request or bug report in the [Ledger Sync repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-ledger-sync). We look forward to your feedback and contributions.","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/5d3179bd-bb61-4335-b09c-2e44de48a282/","default_content":"The Cardano Foundation has been developing a Java-based data provisioning tool called Ledger Sync, which gives access to Cardano blockchain data."},"name":"accessing-cardano-blockchain-data-with-ledger-sync.md","sha":"becf0a6e2e2f5aa7c8227874caee6e8371e35a14","resource_href":"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/accessing-cardano-blockchain-data-with-ledger-sync/"},{"title":"Cardano Summit 2023: Day 2 recap","language":"en","banner_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/e2824ae1-767b-4156-93c3-3079c2374069/","meta_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/1e4b408b-c866-459f-af4e-9b60968a0457/","thumbnail_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/310ec5c1-0c24-4640-8da3-c1333c1c28d1/","layout":"news","news_item_content":{"show_excerpt":"true","date":"2023-11-07T10:30:56.350Z","author":"https://ucarecdn.com/d91681b5-17a1-499b-910a-766ef7ac525d/-/crop/1756x2321/0,0/-/preview/|David Taylor~~~Chief Marketing Officer","cat":"all","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/21ef5dd0-d9ea-4225-9e0f-35fc6919d3c4/","body":"Following [day 1’s](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-summit-2023-day-1-recap/) sessions about operational resilience and education, the [Cardano Summit 2023’s](https://summit.cardano.org/) second conference day offered extensive workshops plus panel discussions on adoption and impact. More than 35 sessions with over 70 speakers leading up to the Gala Awards Dinner that closed the event. Charles Hoskinson, CEO and Founder of [IOG](https://iohk.io/), praised the event during [his closing remarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzLdZxkfAeQ), noting the amazing results and how the Summit has grown from year to year. “Every year the Cardano Foundation does this, it gets better and better”, said Hoskinson. ## Improving existing systems and circumstances With several masterclasses already taking place, the Pitch Arena hosted a panel about current implementations of blockchain solutions to [elevate on-chain utility and pioneer groundbreaking approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe6isr5M274), specifically those designed to address the needs of emerging markets. Micky Watkins, CEO of [World Mobile](https://worldmobile.io/en), noted that 2.7 billion people worldwide remain financially disconnected, with another 3 billion underserved. Glen Jordan, CEO and Co-Founder of [Empowa](https://empowa.io/), pointed to the African continent as an example of blockchain’s potential. Indeed, the panel highlighted how emerging technologies seem particularly well-suited to address the continent’s needs. ![Workshop with Orcfax at the Cardano Summit 2023](https://ucarecdn.com/2334b70e-caf3-47da-a936-e1309280388d/ \"Workshop with Orcfax at the Cardano Summit 2023\") Over at the Main Stage, the [topic of traceability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyLYhExI5E4) saw a diverse panel of experts discuss data provenance in agriculture, law enforcement, forensics, and resource development. When discussions turned to protocol selection, Alexis Pappas, Chief Innovation Officer at [GuildOne](https://guild1.co/), shared that her company chose Cardano because of its reliability, academic rigor, and development process, all of which closely serve the needs of enterprises. Genevieve Leveille, CEO and Principal Founder of [AgriLedger](https://agriledger.io/), highlighted that the objectives within the agriculture sector go beyond track and tracing of the goods, it also becomes necessary to track and trace “what happens to the goods, who does what, does it meet the requirements, and finally, the most important thing, is track and trace of the money back to everybody so everyone gets paid at the same time a fair amount”. Sebastian Zilliacus, Managing Director of [EMURGO Media](https://www.emurgo.io/media/), examined [what people can anticipate from decentralized social media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE1EyC8xSj0) and how to maximize its benefits. Zilliacus emphasized that Web3 or decentralized social media systems not only allow user data to move between social media platforms, they also provide creators with full control of what they develop and share. The panel “[Dubai’s Web3 Evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCW6_tiZ3Ic)” examined how the city has solidified its position as a global center of Web3 through forward-thinking regulations and robust infrastructure. Speaking on the metropolis’ ambition, Oliver von Wolff, Founder and CEO of [Helion Capital](https://www.helion-capital.com/), reinforced that Dubai’s richness originates from the openness of its people to innovation. Dr. Marwan Al Zarouni of the [Dubai Blockchain Center](https://blockchaincenter.ae/) further reinforced the city’s entrepreneurial spirit and highlighted that Dubai’s geographic location makes it an ideal hub for collaboration with other nations. ## Inspiring the future While [discussing the importance of open source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WP0RAMQHBE), Christian Grobmeier, OSS Developer and Trainer at [Grobmeier Solutions GmbH](https://grobmeier.solutions/), pointed out that community has a paramount role within the realm of open source, and indeed must take precedence over code “because code you can debug, you can fix it, you can write it, you can even delete it”, but “community needs more care”. In fact, the existence of an outstanding community probably ensures having “great code and a project which is actually able to fix their bugs”. Fernando Luis Vázquez Cao, CEO of [SBI Digital Asset Holdings](https://www.sbidah.com/) and Board Member of the Cardano Foundation, also added that, in order to reach mainstream adoption, an open source community requires the right incentives and governance models, allowing developers to address issues specifically relevant to their needs. ![Teodor Petricevic speaking a the Cardano Summit 2023](https://ucarecdn.com/ec76aa3e-126c-4e79-a974-503216bb83f4/ \"Teodor Petricevic speaking a the Cardano Summit 2023\") “[The Power of Blockchain for Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-zP59L2r4U)” panel, on the other hand, explored the transformative potential of blockchain for positive impact. With the world witnessing an unprecedented number of forcibly displaced people—approximately 114 million—Carmen Hett, Corporate Treasurer at [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/), stressed the need for solutions that can deliver with speed, and pointed out that blockchain makes it “really seamless” to serve and deliver aid directly to those in need. It likewise lowers costs, meaning blockchain benefits humanitarian aid both on the disbursement and the fundraising sides. After a full day of panels and workshops, the Gala Awards Dinner announced the winners of the [Cardano Summit](https://voting.summit.cardano.org/leaderboard) Awards plus the first-ever [Summit Hackathon](https://summit.cardano.org/hackathon/) live from the Armani Pavilion in Dubai. Team [Maestro](https://gomaestro.org/), led by Marvin Bertin, won the Hackathon prize for their project “No-code Plugin for Governance Smart Contracts”, while the Summit Awards spanned 10 different categories: * Ambassador: Guillermo Moratorio * DeFi / DEX: [Minswap](https://minswap.org/) * Developer or Developer Tools: [Strica](http://strica.io) & [TxPipe](https://txpipe.io/) (tie) * Blockchain for Good: [World Mobile](https://worldmobile.io/en) * CIPs: Adam Dean * Educational Influencer: [Farid - Dapp Central](https://www.youtube.com/@DappCentral) * Marketplace: [JPG Store](https://www.jpg.store/) * Most Impactful SSPO: [SMAUG](https://smaug.pool.pm/) * NFT Project: [HOSKY](http://hosky.io) * Self Sovereign Identity (SSI): [IAMX](http://iamx.id) ![Networking at the Cardano Summit 2023](https://ucarecdn.com/6341e2cc-b436-4714-b446-2c565bf7c1ab/ \"Networking at the Cardano Summit 2023\") Sessions have become [available on demand](https://summit.cardano.org/on-demand-content-2023/).

Day 1 of the Summit featured over 35 sessions and more than 55 speakers discussing and presenting about operational resilience as well as education. ![Panel discusstion at the Cardano Summit 2023](https://ucarecdn.com/f2b4d45c-7d2f-4d55-8a00-15a764247a4d/ \"Panel discusstion at the Cardano Summit 2023\") Dr. Marwan Al Zarouni welcomed everyone to Dubai, explaining how the United Arab Emirates brings different cultures together to build the future. Stressing the country’s strategy to leverage blockchain technology where it proves most applicable, Dr. Al Zarouni also prompted everyone to not rely on luck or circumstances but instead take initiative. ## A blockchain to resonate through history In the keynote “[Enterprise Blockchain is Dead; Long Live Blockchain for Enterprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzyWQOW5ivE)” Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, discussed how crucial it is to maintain and nurture consent at all times as digital technologies get progressively more interwoven into the fabric of society. Gregaard emphasized that operational resilience has become not only a feature of digital infrastructures but actually one of the main drivers of sustainable progress. In fact, Cardano keeps evolving, consequently enabling broader horizons for blockchain. It stands as a public infrastructure designed for the 21st century and meant to enhance the social systems of the world. As Gregaard said, Cardano is “not designed for the few, it’s designed for the masses”. Indeed, it has an ethos that enhances participatory governance and social systems. So Gregaard thanked the ecosystem for believing in, as well as building on Cardano, and concluded by highlighting how Cardano sends a “clarion call to all industries and social systems to join us in this journey, to partake in a future that is not only resilient but also equitable and transparent”. The panel “[Essential Governance: Building Strong Blockchain Foundations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHlofcMNNo8)” took place next on the Main Stage, drawing on insights from the [Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com/)'s research about the essential elements for building robust blockchain foundations. The discussion explored topics like governance models, organization structures, processes, and ways to ensure blockchain initiatives succeed. Dr. Bernhard Kronfeller, Partner & Associate Director at Boston Consulting Group, emphasized that the race for mass adoption has already started within an evolving regulatory environment, making it essential for projects without a solid footing to pivot quickly. At the Pitch Arena, representatives from the Cardano Foundation, [EMURGO](https://www.emurgo.io/), [IOG](https://iohk.io/), and [Cardano MENA](https://twitter.com/CardanoMENA) explored [transparency in the age of Voltaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1DoWRyMVw4), the governance phase of the Cardano blockchain. The panel examined why this era will require accessible solutions, tools, and interfaces that anyone can use worldwide, even those new to Cardano. At the core of these considerations, Juana Attieh, from [LALKUL](https://twitter.com/lalkulpool) and Cardano MENA, noted that the ongoing challenge of governance lies in it being endless, which makes it important to think of new ways to engage and motivate participation. Charles Hoskinson, CEO and Founder of IOG, and Eran Barak, CEO of [Midnight](https://midnight.network/), [took to the Main Stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvV2h89cTo8) to discuss the importance of Cardano’s builder and creator community in the age of Voltaire. The two reflected on how these individuals set Cardano apart from other protocols beyond the realm of technical fundamentals. In exploring Cardano’s journey and its future, Hoskinson elaborated that having a governance system and giving people the power to change it can lead to amazing things. ## Building a more connected and inclusive ecosystem Back on the Pitch Arena stage, panelists from the Cardano Foundation, [Wanchain](https://www.wanchain.org/), [Maestro](https://www.gomaestro.org/), and [Router Chain](https://www.routerprotocol.com/) explored [world applications, classification, obstacles, and security aspects of interoperability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8qJwed0f-o). Marvin Bertin, CEO of Maestro, noted that enterprises care most about functionality and creating value for their users, making it important to deliver cross-chain functionality while avoiding to overburden users with the management of Web3’s technical complexities. In “[Diversifying Access to Blockchain with Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPmJOoorJiA)” the panel explored how people can harness their theoretical knowledge and apply it within the blockchain space. Describing the current ecosystem, Nikhail Joshi, COO of [EMURGO](https://www.emurgo.io/), highlighted that a multi-pronged solution from governments, organizations, and the private sector is needed to fully educate societies. Over on the Main Stage, panelists also delved into the [world of blockchain education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkDjdQVwHrE), exploring how equipping individuals with blockchain knowledge fosters innovation and industry growth. On this point, Marcelo A.F. Curi, Blockchain and Crypto-Token Economy Certified Solution Architect, highlighted the shortage of understanding in regards to select protocols, a reality that can stifle innovation, further stressing the importance of educating leaders and key stakeholders alongside the broader society. Dr. Jasmina Locker, on the other hand, underlined how blockchain allows for transparency and trust, including when it comes to student credentials, making it easier for them to have their records verified when moving to different countries. Next up, a panel of legal experts navigated the [global blockchain regulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74I1OB4TlJI) situation and explored where the industry goes from here. The group noted that after years of fact-finding and development, licensing for blockchain-based business models has started reaching mainstream debate. However, compared to the existing financial market, the jurisdictional differences still remain significant. Beyond regulatory uncertainty, Robert Kopitsch, Secretary General at [Blockchain for Europe](https://www.blockchain4europe.eu/), surmised that, due to frequent doubts about the cost of adopting blockchain, creating incentive models for incumbents stands as one of the biggest hurdles worldwide. Teodor Petricevic, Accelerator Lead at United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), [announced the third Cardano Global Impact Challenge partner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svfQAa423ds). [Tadamon](https://tadamon.community/), a UNDP-led community platform for civil society empowerment, has partnered with the Cardano Foundation to increase awareness of how blockchain technology can address the development challenges faced by civil society organizations (CSOs) across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The partnerships will develop capacity-building programs, knowledge-sharing initiatives, training sessions, and collaborative events to foster knowledge about blockchain technology. Day 1 of the Summit concluded with a desert dining experience, offering attendees a feast of traditional Middle Eastern hospitality amidst a thrilling show.

Gregaard mentioned that potential investors often ask him how they can investigate a project’s product-market fit, plus the readiness and longevity of Cardano. For the last two, Gregaard provided direct answers: The sheer vitality of the ecosystem’s projects, of everyone present in the room, and the number of Cardano repositories on GitHub provide abundant proof. For the first question, however, Gregaard urged the projects to advocate for themselves. The final, top 10 contestants of the Battle of the Builders, presented their pitches in front of the jury and Summit attendees. Each project received five minutes to present their project. ![Battle of the Builders Pitch Competition](https://ucarecdn.com/234f765f-6055-4513-91aa-8869209a5f1a/ \"Battle of the Builders Pitch Competition\") * [NMKR](https://www.nmkr.io/): Allows users to mint their own NFTs or build a secondary NFT marketplace. * [NEWM](https://newm.io/): Aims to provide a music streaming marketplace governed by musicians and their fans by giving artists ownership of their creative content. * [Xerberus](https://xerberus.io/): Enables users to assess and manage the risk of their digital assets portfolio. * [FiDa](https://fida.finance/): Tokenizes insurance contracts, aiming to address existing industry challenges that result from increasing claim costs. * [Mehen USDM](https://mehen.io/): Looks to create bridges between traditional finance and blockchain via a fiat-backed stablecoin. * [Iagon](https://iagon.com/): Means to provide users with an AI-driven, shared storage platform that simultaneously ensures data compliance, privacy, and security. * [Maestro](https://www.gomaestro.org/): Gives users a complete Web3 stack that makes it easy to build DApps, DeFi protocols and others; it also offers a smart contract marketplace. * [zkFold](https://zkfold.io/): Offers a zero-knowledge rollups scaling solution for the Cardano blockchain. * [Finest](https://finest.investments/): Presents users with an accessible platform to trade tokenized real world assets (RWA). * [TVVIN](https://tvvin.com/): Intends to improve the accessibility of traditional assets like precious metals, minerals, and commodities by leveraging blockchain, AI, and metaverse technologies.

The Cardano ledger specifications outline formulas to calculate these rewards. Bearing this in mind and as part of the Cardano Foundation’s efforts towards the operational resilience of the network, we have open sourced a [node-independent reward calculation](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-java-rewards-calculation). The project intends to achieve a means of performing and validating the rewards calculation that is independent of a single implementation. It likewise looks to provide comprehensive documentation related to Cardano’s treasury, reserves, and pool rewards. As an open source repository under the MIT license, the initiative also deepens the Foundation’s commitment towards open source maturity and aims to garner contributions from the ecosystem at large. Finally, the calculation can equally serve as an educational tool, for example in relation to how protocol parameter changes could impact the flow of funds. It ultimately enhances transparency and improves operational resilience. ## Reinforcing operational resilience with open source The Cardano blockchain offers several unique, carefully considered features. A key one is that staked ada remains in user wallets, enabling transfers to other wallets at any time. While this functionality has benefits, it also presents challenges in implementing rewards calculations. This necessitates the use of snapshots for rewards calculation, as outlined in the ledger specification. The process begins with the calculation of new reserves, fees, the total rewards pot, and the treasury. Subsequently, pool rewards are determined based on this total rewards pot. The pool rewards are used to calculate the stake pool delegators’ and stake pool operators’ rewards. Due to the requirement for snapshot-based calculations, it can happen that a stake account might become unregistered after taking a snapshot. The stake account therefore cannot receive rewards after the calculation is completed and needs custom rules to handle those special situations. These rules are naturally spread across the code base, as the calculation process itself is distributed over time. The [cardano-ledger repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger) aggregates most of the business logic, alongside relevant documentation. Some additional components required for this process can be found in the cardano-node itself or in the [ouroboros-network](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network) repository. The code gets executed using a slot-based scheduler, which can prove challenging to read and follow for those unfamiliar with the codebase. While certain optimizations have been introduced to enhance the calculation's performance, these optimizations can make the code less straightforward to understand. The open source rewards calculation aims to address these challenges while maintaining the robust features native to the Cardano network. ## The Cardano rewards mechanism Cardano ledger specification includes multiple equations that collectively define the [flow of ada at the end of each epoch](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-java-rewards-calculation). Each node will independently calculate the rewards per epoch in a distributed manner with any potential rewards then distributed based on the consensus mechanism. Notably, no one entity completes this calculation nor can anyone withhold rewards. These ada rewards are calculated every epoch and derive from the interaction of two sources: transaction fees and monetary expansion. * Transaction fees: At the end of each epoch the value from the fee pot (the sum of all transaction fees in that epoch) goes into the total rewards pot. * Monetary expansion: In addition to transaction fees, a fixed percentage of the reserve is put into the same rewards pot. The total rewards pot is then divided into two segments. The first part goes into the treasury, while the second forms the stake pool rewards pot. Notably, the mentioned reserves originally started with approximately 14 billion ada and have decreased gradually. Simultaneously, another calculation computes the pool reward, utilizing the stake pool parameters that, in conjunction with the apparent pool performance, determine the individual stake pool rewards. The resulting value forms the foundation for calculating both delegator and operator rewards. Importantly, all these calculations depend on protocol parameters. The rewards calculation forms an integral part of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, making it crucial to educate people on how it works. This knowledge empowers people to choose a stake pool that fits with their vision and values. ## How the rewards calculation improves transparency The treasury, reserves, rewards, deposits, and fees—oftentimes referred to as ada-pots—sum up to the max supply of 45 billion ada. While anyone can review ada-pot numbers on Cardano [blockchain explorers](https://cexplorer.io/pot) and on [Cardano DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync), these platforms are only able to supply the final output of the calculations, without any underlying data available to confirm how those were calculated. Although these calculations exist in the Haskell code of the node and the ledger repositories, they employ a complex, highly distributed formula implementation. For this reason, the Foundation started pursuing a [node-independent reward calculation](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-java-rewards-calculation) that implements the formulas outlined in the [Cardano ledger specifications](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/releases/download/cardano-ledger-spec-2023-04-03/shelley-ledger.pdf) and serves as a documentation resource for handling edge cases where the specified formula does not align with the actual implementation. For example, in one instance, a bug in the node implementation resulted in a pool owner running two different pools but with the same reward address receiving rewards for only one stake pool. In this case, fixing the bug led to additional rewards from the treasury being issued to pool owners. While those manual interventions are completely in line with the protocol specification and recorded in a transparent manner via so called move instantaneous rewards ([MIR](<https://cardano.stackexchange.com/questions/9245/what-is-a-mir-certificate-what-does-mir-mean-in-general#:~:text=An%20ELI5%20explanation%20of%20MIR,the%20reserves%20and%20the%20treasury.)>)) certificates, the ada-pots calculated for this epoch would be incorrect. Specifically, if one would calculate the treasury value with the plain formula for this epoch, it would become apparent that it does not match the actual amount of ada held. In short, without knowledge of such extraordinary events, the discrepancy between the formula and the treasury value would prove challenging to trace and there would be less funds in the treasury than indicated by the formula. ## Advantages of open sourcing the formula implementation The rewards calculation was originally integrated into LedgerSync, the Java-based data pipeline developed to supply the Cardano Foundation’s [new Cardano explorer](https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/en/) with data from the Cardano blockchain. However, the Foundation’s Engineering Team soon realized that untangling the multiple components involved in different aspects of the calculation would prove quite complex. The diversity of input data, which includes [specifications](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/releases/download/cardano-ledger-spec-2023-04-03/shelley-ledger.pdf), blog posts, forum threads, and self-hosted community documentation, means that gathering the necessary information from various sources to comprehensively understand the flow of ada becomes particularly time-consuming. Open sourcing the rewards calculation, on the other hand, can empower public inspection, review, and verification of the algorithm as well as the code used to determine how rewards are distributed. This approach  similarly helps build trust in the Cardano infrastructure by serving as a repository that includes an interactive chart explaining the ada flow at the end of an epoch, plus reports that highlight the differences between the formula and actual value. It also acts as a useful way to educate people about Cardano’s decentralized treasury system and contributes to providing insights into the use of transaction fees. As an open source repository, the rewards calculation further engages the community, propelling everyone to contribute as much documentation as possible. Moreover, it provides a tool for technical enablement as it exposes an API allowing users to compute values currently only available with [Cardano DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync), a Haskell tool from IOG for crawling node data and making it accessible in a PostgreSQL database. ## Working towards rewards calculation transparency As discussed in the earlier edge case example, using the formula for the next epoch to calculate, for example, the treasury value, will sometimes not yield accurate results. This dynamic can arise when transferring funds to pay a [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/) proposal or, for instance, when using a MIR certificate to compensate for pool rewards missed due to a bug. While transparently recorded on the Cardano blockchain via the MIR certificate mechanism, such edge cases are not always documented in detail publicly, leading to a lack of historical background and therefore significantly compromising transparency, which in turn results in uncertainty and decreased trust. Establishing suitable documentation can prevent this, enabling future reviews and audits as well as improvements to the documentation, thus strengthening the credibility and operational resilience of Cardano. The Foundation’s work started with the formula implementation and edge case documentation, but some remaining unknowns still need to be addressed. For instance, it is necessary to account for the early Catalyst funds or MIR certificates before epoch 271, as they have no metadata attached to them. Through open sourcing this formula, the Foundation hopes to collaborate with community members to establish a data source-independent solution. Currently, we have a [Koios](https://koios.rest/) data provider and a data provider for static JSON files, which serve aggregated data. Additionally, a scoped indexer—potentially based on [Yaci-Store](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-store), a Java-based Cardano datastore implementation—would prove helpful in ensuring maximum transparency in the reward calculation. This initiative also ultimately concerns the treasury value, which Cardano uses to fund the decentralized development of the ecosystem, pool rewards, and transaction fees. Consequently, it directly impacts aspects that every Cardano user should care about, including the rewards deployment in the ecosystem they are a part of. At the same time, all contributors, whether sharing code or information, play an important role in bringing more trust and transparency to the ecosystem, therefore improving conditions for increased blockchain adoption. ## Cracking the calculation The Foundation generates a [report alongside every new version of the repository](https://cardano-foundation.github.io/cf-java-rewards-calculation/report-latest/treasury_calculation.html). We added the average absolute difference between the calculation and the actual treasury value as a metric, and together with the community we hope to achieve a reduction in this value over time. Contributions to this repository are not limited to code alone; people can add data, links, documentation, and insights regarding the substantial differences observed in some epochs. The repository itself follows a test-driven approach, so it makes sense to begin by creating tests, such as those related to specific pool rewards in specific epochs. The Foundation has created the report for the treasury only, but we see potential to introduce this type of report for the other constituents of the ada-pots as well as detailed reports about selected stake pools and member rewards in the future. Most of the time, the treasury value averages around 3,500 ada higher than the formula predicts. The pool reap rule directs unclaimable pool deposits—such as when a pool retires and the associated stake address has already been deregistered—back to the treasury. Additionally, each pool can earn a maximum ada value for each epoch. The treasury also directs any difference between the value calculated by the formula and the maximum value. These adjustments to the current implementation should reduce the average absolute difference. The Foundation has already experienced some success in tackling the fundamentals of the calculation and identifying explanations for some of these discrepancies. It would, however, be valuable to have comprehensive documentation for every outgoing transaction from the treasury. Next steps also involve implementing the Pool Reap rule, as well as adding capped rewards to the treasury, incorporating MIR certificates, and directing unclaimed rewards to the reserves. In addition, while with each new epoch we currently reset to a known value to prevent forwarding errors from previous epochs, in the future it would prove beneficial to have a scoped consumer for fees, retired pools, deregistered stake accounts, pool updates, and more. This structure would enable dynamic calculations based on the previous calculation. If, however, there is another unknown in the calculation, leading to a disparity between the calculation and the actual values, an in-depth examination of the Haskell implementation in the [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) and [cardano-ledger](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger) repositories could be completed. This scenario would aim to identify changes that account for the discrepancies by exploring the commit history and issue discussions. Moving forward, the Foundation intends to utilize the reports and interactive charts coming from this repository to explain ada tokenomics to regulators, businesses, and institutions. In September, we also met with teams from [Koios CNTools](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/blob/alpha/docs/Scripts/cntools.md) to introduce them to the repository and gather initial feedback. They welcomed the initiative as well as the idea of implementing and documenting the reward calculation and noted that having other developers port this Java reference implementation to additional languages would provide supplementary value. An open source approach always enriches the ecosystem, offering mutual benefits to all involved parties while simultaneously fostering transparency and improving the likelihood of widespread adoption of blockchain technology. The Cardano Foundation, therefore, plans to continue open sourcing repositories and solutions with a view to promoting Cardano’s open source maturity.","cat":"all","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/60f34ed5-8aad-43bd-8080-570129534cee/","default_content":"We have open sourced a node-independent reward calculation to perform and validate the rewards calculation that is independent of a single implementation."},"name":"releasing-an-open-source-rewards-calculation.md","sha":"0e7fbca09ffb6455040c569f916dada583655903","resource_href":"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/releasing-an-open-source-rewards-calculation/"},{"title":"Simplifying Cardano DApp development with Demeter","language":"en","banner_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/627b9eee-8990-4dad-9986-b3a288494c89/","meta_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/dc8d97d9-cadc-4359-9c2c-c622c66ae99d/","thumbnail_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/ff8391d7-1282-49ba-beaf-26969535ef81/","layout":"news","news_item_content":{"show_excerpt":"true","date":"2023-10-19T21:17:25.495Z","author":"https://ucarecdn.com/b192352a-1e03-437b-84a7-f8384c14f61f/-/crop/2871x3517/0,0/-/preview/|Matthias Benkort~~~Technical Director of Open Source Development","cat":"all","body":"Given the blockchain engineering expertise required to manage individual Cardano components, getting started on the network can prove challenging. This dynamic becomes especially true when developers want to refrain from utilizing centralized solutions or managing infrastructure. For those developers, the Cardano Foundation recognizes the value of [Demeter](https://demeter.run/) and how it can foster ecosystem adoption and growth. Demeter is a software platform built to streamline the development process within the Cardano ecosystem and make building decentralized applications (DApps) more developer-friendly. As an all-in-one solution, Demeter enables developers to easily and quickly deploy testnet and mainnet environments. ## Building on the Cardano Network In a broader sense, Demeter aims to remove barriers to entry for those looking to launch applications on Cardano. As such, the Foundation has provided TxPipe, the company behind Demeter, with a one-time grant. This grant will subsidize a free tier that offers limited access to the Demeter platform. Specifically, this tier will enable access to: * A Cardano Node configured for preview, pre-prod, or (later) mainnet networks; * Various developer tools from the ecosystem, such as [Ogmios](https://ogmios.dev/), cardano-db-sync, [Scrolls](https://github.com/txpipe/scrolls#readme), [Oura](https://github.com/txpipe/oura), Kupo, and Hydra; * Workspaces with starter-kits for various use cases (e.g., Plutus development with Haskell, Aiken, Helios, etc.) with ready-to-use templates used for quickly bootstrapping new projects. Through this engagement, the Foundation intends to address some of the challenges associated with developing applications on the Cardano blockchain—namely, onboarding new developers. ## Onboarding Complexity Cardano follows a minimalistic approach when it comes to core components. For example, the Cardano node is meant to only do what is necessary to ensure network performance. Specifically, the node only stores information required to follow and validate the chain. For this reason, many responsibilities get pushed into client applications. This approach aims to keep the maintenance of core components reasonable while allowing the ecosystem to develop necessary modular solutions in parallel. However, for new Cardano users, this dynamic can become overwhelming as development requires the simultaneous use of multiple tools. From chain indexers, wallets, transaction builders, chain watchers, and explorers, a myriad of tools exist that, once properly orchestrated, can solve practically any problem. Some typical tools found in a Cardano development environment include: * [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) * [cardano-db-Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) * [cardano-submit-API](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/tree/master/cardano-submit-api) * [cardano-wallet](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet) * [cardano-graphQL](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-graphql) * [Ogmios](https://ogmios.dev/) * [Kupo](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo#readme) * [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/) * [Marlowe](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano) * [Kuber](https://github.com/dQuadrant/kuber) Given the diversity of modules, platforms like Demeter become particularly useful in helping developers get started with Cardano. Specifically, Demeter makes the orchestration and deployment of these components simple. This dynamic enables seamless integrations, encouraging innovation within the Cardano ecosystem. ## Infrastructure to Developer Ratio In addition to the startup process, the typical infrastructure components found in a Cardano development environment require significant resources to function, such as CPU, memory, and disk storage. If we consider that, during the development process, a developer might need to connect to several Cardano networks, like preview, preprod, mainnet, etc., the resource requirements can become prohibitive for some developers—even those using powerful machines. Data must also be synchronized from every network each time, making establishing a development environment particularly cumbersome. Some standard techniques exist to mitigate the problem, for example, using containerized workloads that can be paused during periods of inactivity. Although valid, these workarounds offer partial solutions and often require configuring and connecting pieces manually and individually. A better use of resources would be to share instances of these infrastructure components among several developers. The relation between infrastructure and developers should follow a ratio of 1:N, with the cost of running the infrastructure divided among several participants. As a cloud-based solution, Demeter enables multiple participants to share the cost of infrastructure, which encourages more developers to join the Cardano ecosystem. This dynamic promotes a vibrant and sustainable developer community, driving innovation and growth while minimizing the financial burden on individual developers. ## Multiple Tech Stacks Blockchain development involves multiple disciplines: frontend development, backend development, smart contract development, and more. Although most of the core Cardano development remains highly Haskell-centric, a tendency toward introducing different programming languages and frameworks is already noticeable. In fact, many well-furnished libraries and ecosystems exist in alternative languages such as Rust, Java, Go, or C#. This trend is also visible on-chain with the advent of new programming platforms such as Aiken or Helios, which offer compelling alternatives to Haskell. Demeter provides a unified platform that consolidates resources and tools for those ecosystems. This dynamic streamlines development, making it more accessible and efficient for developers across different stacks, fostering a cohesive and collaborative environment for building on Cardano. ## Sandbox Learning Environments Large-scale adoption of Cardano also entails attracting developers outside the present ecosystem, addressing state-of-the-art expectations, and furnishing developers with appropriate testing environments. Supporting temporary, fully-capable sandbox environments that spin up in a few minutes provides developers with a mechanism to experiment with hands-on projects, showcasing the capabilities of their system. Demeter aims to adopt a similar strategy, supplying extensions that support sandbox or testnet environments, enabling developers to refine and validate their projects without the burden of managing the infrastructure themselves. Once ready, they can keep hosting it on Demeter or export their setup as Terraform or Kubernetes configurations—two widely used technologies for managing infrastructure. ## Low-Level Platform as a Service (PaaS) Many Cardano ecosystem services offer web-based APIs to facilitate blockchain interactions at a high-level abstraction (e.g., Blockfrost, Koios, GoMaestro,  etc.). These services eliminate the complexity of interacting with the underlying layer of components. However, projects working on fine-tuning performance or those that require more flexibility in their workflows would also require lower-level access, including: * direct access to the Ouroboros Node-to-Node & Node-to-Client mini-protocols; * direct access to Ogmios WebSocket & HTTP endpoints; * direct access to the cardano-submit-api’s HTTP endpoints; * direct PostgreSQL access to cardano-db-sync data; * direct access to Kupo’s HTTP endpoints Some blockchain protocols provide services at different levels of abstraction, both high-level API abstraction and low-level protocol endpoints. For example, solutions that provide “nodes as a service” have become common. Similarly, Demeter offers developers the flexibility to work at the level of abstraction that suits their needs, whether they require a simplified interface or deeper protocol access. This flexibility can enhance the Cardano ecosystem's appeal and usability, attracting a more comprehensive range of developers and use cases. ## A technical description of Demeter Demeter provides cloud environments organized by cluster. A cluster represents a group of computational resources and tools that different projects can consume simultaneously in a controlled and measured fashion. Clusters are elastic by nature, meaning they acquire more resources automatically when needed and shrink during idle times. A Demeter project is defined as one or more developers interacting with the cluster to build and deploy a Cardano DApp. On each cluster, developers can enable a variety of extensions to access different useful services, such as: * Cardano Nodes: fully-synced, managed versions of the Cardano Node that can be accessed through a private network using Ouroboros mini-protocols. * Cardano DB-Sync: a managed version of cardano-db-sync. Data can be retrieved through direct SQL access to highly available PostgreSQL instances. * Cardano Ogmios: highly available instances of Ogmios that can be accessed directly through WebSocket or HTTP. * Cardano Submit API: private, load-balanced instances of the cardano-submit-api that can be accessed directly via HTTP for submitting serialized Cardano transactions. * Cardano Oura Webhooks: allows developers to create automated event-driven actions in response to Cardano blockchain events powered by Oura. * Cardano Kupo: a lightweight and configurable chain-index for the Cardano blockchain alongside a developer-friendly HTTP API. * Cardano Blockfrost RYO: a self-hosted instance of the Blockfrost API, providing a real gateway to the Cardano blockchain. * Cardano Kuber: Haskell library and API service for building and composing Cardano transactions. * Cardano Hydra Node: a self-hosted Hydra node alongside a terminal-user interface and useful dashboard to simplify the creation and management of Hydra heads. * Marlowe Runtime: enables the execution of Marlowe smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. This comprehensive tooling supports the Cardano ecosystem by streamlining development within a unified platform. In technical terms, Demeter simplifies access to blockchain data and services while allowing for robust testing environments. In keeping with the Foundation’s support of projects that significantly contribute to the ecosystem, especially those that can have ample future impact, we decided to collaborate with TxPipe and give the ecosystem access to a free Demeter tier. By structuring the Foundation’s grant in this way, we aim to help TxPipe reach a wider audience, broaden the appeal of the Cardano network, and drive innovation across the ecosystem. ## Measuring the partnership impact Since TxPipe enabled a free-tier cluster in the EU region on 21 June 2023, several user metrics have shown significant growth. Notably, in August: * 386 new users signed up * 452 projects were created * 317 grants were given to new users* * 108 workspaces were created Additionally, in September: * 446 new users signed up * 525 projects were created * 391 grants were given to new users* * 114 workspaces were created With the free-tier engagement complete as of 30 September, the Foundation will now review its overall impact, aiming to determine the effectiveness of the grant. Should these findings indicate growing usership, additional opportunities may exist to work alongside TxPipe on future adoption initiatives. \\*Sponsored by the Cardano Foundation (every new user receives the grant only for the first project they create).","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/02db09e8-65e0-4c00-b281-37796f7499fa/","default_content":"\"Demeter streamlines the development process and makes building decentralized applications (DApps) on Cardano more developer-friendly. \""},"name":"simplifying-cardano-dapp-development-with-demeter.md","sha":"99a24e5aa895157b0dec378784eb5de474792d29","resource_href":"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/simplifying-cardano-dapp-development-with-demeter/"},{"title":"Cardano Foundation Updates Delegation Strategy","language":"en","banner_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/69c066a6-ebd2-44e8-b1b4-b5cf469d7632/","meta_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/a4c039b0-f60e-4231-8fc1-4105c5add074/","thumbnail_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/9b449f1b-cf4c-43d3-a1f9-08059f27db4c/","layout":"news","news_item_content":{"show_excerpt":"true","date":"2023-10-12T20:01:25.646Z","cat":"all","body":"Over the past [two years our delegation strategy](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-foundations-new-delegation-methodology-supporting-the-architects-of-the-future/79594) has seen significant growth and engagement. During this period, we conducted seven delegation rounds, showcasing our commitment to the continuous development and decentralization of the ecosystem. We received 1731 valid applications from various pools, with 454 of these shortlisted, and an average of 65 pools making it to the shortlist per round. Most notably, over the course of these seven rounds, we delegated to 351 pools and of this number, 161 were unique pools. This indicates the high standards and competitiveness that underpin our selection process. We want to continue to encourage people to build something that the community needs, is open-source, and helps the ecosystem thrive. However, the requirements of a protocol constantly evolve as the full technology stack gets deployed. Therefore, the Cardano Foundation frequently revisits and updates its delegation methodology in order to better support the Cardano community and, as such, we are announcing some changes to our delegation methodology. Each of the following changes are aimed at further improving the quality and effectiveness of our delegation approach: 1. Delegation Duration: Instead of a short delegation period of about three months we will move to an extended period of approximately 12 months. An extended delegation period will benefit operators, allowing them to really focus on their contributions. 2. Delegation Packages: We will reduce the number of pools we delegate to, which will increase the size of the packages. This, combined with extended delegation duration, will help enhance the overall quality of our selections plus allow pools to flourish and establish themselves more effectively. 3. Delegation Criteria: We will remove the single pool requirement which will ensure greater flexibility in our selection process. This new approach aims at greater inclusivity. 4. Selection Process:  Our team will now handpick pools based on the data and insights we've gathered. This ensures that our delegation strategy is driven by experience and thorough understanding. 5. Expectations: We understand that greater delegation may tempt pools to raise fees, however, we want to clarify that if pools increase costs or raise fees, we may withdraw delegation. Also, we will closely monitor pools and engage with them on a regular basis to understand how they are actively contributing to the ecosystem. 6. Application Process: As the regular delegation rounds will be replaced with the extended delegation, we will change the application format to a single form. If you are a new pool or undertaking a novel initiative that you believe merits attention, you can use this form to submit your pool for consideration. Additionally, the Cardano Foundation launched its own stake pool [[CAG](https://cardanoscan.io/pool/982f926165ebf6699df8704a16d11c9e13c88c4e02f63e3fe5af7181)]. Maintaining and running a stake pool for a fraction of our own assets means the Foundation will obtain a genuine understanding of topologies, building from source, pre-releases, hard fork preparations, server-resources and network bandwidth. This firsthand knowledge is essential for refining our decisions and offering more nuanced support to our community. To support this project, we have rebalanced the ada across our wallet addresses. A number of our existing wallets will now contribute to funding the CAG stake pool. Meanwhile, the Foundation will continue to use one of its wallets to keep the [one year delegation to WRFGS, the Switzerland for UNHCR poo](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/announcing-second-annual-global-impact-challenge-with-unhcr/)l. We continue to work with [pool.pm to showcase our wallets and current delegation](https://pool.pm/cf/stake) packages. The Cardano Foundation expects the next redelegation round in accordance with this new delegation strategy to happen around mid October.","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/b1a4f46a-d5af-4505-bcc8-19dac3e1a61d/","default_content":"Take a look at the 6 changes aimed at further improving the quality and effectiveness of the delegation strategy and better supporting the Cardano community.","author":"https://ucarecdn.com/0bacce89-175c-418a-affc-11e21fda8d28/-/crop/602x621/94,0/-/preview/|Tommy Kammerer~~~Community Team Director"},"name":"cardano-foundation-updates-delegation-strategy.md","sha":"eceb06e1a7b88600575a236a81413ed8bd18044d","resource_href":"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-foundation-updates-delegation-strategy/"},{"title":"Driving Blockchain Technology: Cardano Foundation’s activities part 4","language":"en","banner_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/e7ce966e-c049-4076-926c-3326c3c52487/","meta_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/ef06909d-b552-45a6-a260-5763c990b49e/","thumbnail_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/a4318f59-9e3f-4d16-bcbb-27fbaa2384ef/","layout":"news","news_item_content":{"show_excerpt":"true","date":"2023-10-11T22:13:14.035Z","author":"https://ucarecdn.com/d91681b5-17a1-499b-910a-766ef7ac525d/-/crop/1756x2321/0,0/-/preview/|David Taylor~~~Chief Marketing Officer","cat":"all","body":"An operationally resilient blockchain ensures the safety, availability, and trustworthiness of its network. It has the ability to endure disruptions, maintaining data integrity and consistency even in the face of unforeseen events. It also meets not only business standards but also regulatory needs. Likewise, resilience strategies such as redundancy and monitoring improve network stability and user confidence. As a public, permissionless blockchain that utilizes proof of stake (PoS), Cardano’s network security increases as on-chain participation grows. The more unique stake pool operators (SPOs) that operate the desired number of pools, the more resilient and decentralized the network becomes, as each such entity independently participates in the creation and validation of the chain’s blocks. Through delegation, community members further diversify the entities responsible for securing the Cardano network. For example, ada holders can delegate across multiple, diverse pools instead of allocating their stake with only a few SPOs, a situation that could allow for the greater influence of nefarious actors. Part of the Cardano Foundation’s work within [operational resilience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89d8t72C4Uk) focuses on decentralization and providing various experts across the ecosystem with ways of contributing to the network’s future. For instance, the [Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) program](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs) allows the technical community to propose new features and help shape the network. Additionally, the [Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/) assists all those building on the network as well as technical newcomers, bringing more people on-chain and into Cardano's technical ecosystem—ultimately increasing the operational resilience of the Cardano infrastructure. At the same time, the Foundation’s Integrations Team provides technical support to third-parties during infrastructure upgrades, contributing to seamless transitions. ## A Hard Fork for Interoperability ![Valentine Hard Fork](https://ucarecdn.com/65500a4e-661d-421f-a0df-6ae9ffb9cfc5/ \"Valentine Hard Fork\") The aptly named [Valentine hard fork](https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF/status/1625638306666135554) happened on 14 February and marked the beginning of an important chapter for Cardano. With the implementation of the Valentine Standards for Efficient Cryptography (SECP) upgrade complete, Cardano's capabilities for cross-chain interoperability will expand due to cryptographic updates. Public key cryptography, a cornerstone of blockchain security, involves intricate mathematical methods that generate unique digital signatures to validate the authenticity of digital documents and assets. While Cardano relies on the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA), a significant sector of the blockchain landscape often employs the SECP elliptic curve, utilized in the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr signatures. Traditionally, when Cardano developers needed to engage with other blockchains that utilized ECDSA or Schnorr signatures, the process was arduous, time-consuming, and expensive, exposing potential security vulnerabilities. The introduction of the Valentine (SECP) upgrade addressed these challenges directly. By integrating a built-in function that accommodates both ECDSA and Schnorr signatures, the upgrade streamlined the process, rendering it fast, straightforward, cost-effective, and fortified against security threats. As a result, Cardano now supports a new era of interoperability, ensuring developers more familiar with alternative ecosystems can easily build on the network. Like in any hard fork preparations, stake pool operators (SPOs) carefully executed critical scripting adjustments to start the process. Projects also completed backward compatibility as these third parties utilize Cardano components when interacting with the blockchain. Whether using wallets, nodes, or the Cardano Rosetta application programming interface (API), this compatibility check proves essential to safeguard processes and ensure they remain unchanged after the hard fork. For example, the [Cardano Rosetta application programming interface (API)](https://www.rosetta-api.org/) is an open standard designed to simplify blockchain deployment and interaction. Specific implementations of the API ensure developers can use external applications to interface with different blockchains similarly. Given the vital role of this infrastructure, a hard fork must not interrupt such functionality. For this reason, the Cardano Foundation’s Integrations Team informs exchanges and other third parties of technical updates and anticipated mainnet upgrades ahead of time. In the lead-up to the Valentine upgrade, the team again educated exchanges on the impending hard forks, equipping them with the knowledge to navigate the new features and successfully execute required upgrades. Notably, certain exchanges operate autonomously, managing their unspent transaction output (UTxO) and address management code. The Integrations Team offers comprehensive guidance for these entities, ensuring smooth software updates. Additionally, the team coordinates efforts with exchanges reliant on Foundation-maintained components and libraries, ensuring they are well-prepared for upcoming hard forks. Throughout this process, the Integrations Team tracks the progress of each exchange's upgrade status. They also provide technical assistance as needed, evaluating the readiness of the Cardano Node and downstream components. ## Blockchain standards for governance Envisioned as a key component of the Voltaire era, [CIP-1694](https://www.emurgo.io/press-news/the-basics-of-cip-1694/) presents a formal document outlining on-chain governance specifications comprising Cardano native tokens, new on-chain improvement standards, and proposed protocol changes. It adopts a process similar to a request for comment (RFC) from the internet, starting with drafts that individuals, small groups, or large organizations alike can initiate. These drafts would then undergo a collaborative review, refinement, and revision by the global Cardano community to enhance their completeness and accuracy, encompassing technical as well as community-driven topics. Named after Voltaire's birth year, CIP-1694 marks the advent of Cardano's Voltaire phase and looks to play a vital role in shaping the governing bodies of the Cardano protocol. These would include the Constitutional Committee, Delegated Representatives (dReps), and SPOs, while also encompassing the formulation of voting policies and governance specifics. The implementation of this governance structure would occur gradually, unfolding in stages to increase complexity. However, not all decisions would be immediately delegated to the community, and a gradual timeline for the complete process remains in the works. Presently, the proposal's experimental nature invites active discourse and deliberation among diverse stakeholders in the Cardano community, ranging from developers and ada holders to academics or stake pool operators. This ongoing engagement reflects an evolving, collaborative process that continues to drive refinement. ![Photo of people attending a Cardano governance workshop in Zug Switzerland](https://ucarecdn.com/515c47b0-5dc3-4410-a6be-3d35d19c8257/ \"Cardano governance workshop\") The Cardano Foundation contributed to CIP-1694 in multiple ways. Matthias Benkort, Technical Director of Open Source Development, acted as a CIP editor, with others involved in SPO poll planning and execution. The Foundation also continues to work on  a stake-based voting solution that IOG will leverage for polling events related to CIP-1964. Moreover, as part of the discussions, the Foundation got involved in several workshops worldwide in the first half of 2023: * In March, the Foundation’s Markus Gufler, Technical Community Lead, and Matthias Benkort traveled to Denver to participate in the [CIP-1694 workshop organized by IOG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rphMXR1Pb4). * In June, Jeremy Firster, Global Head of Enterprise Partnerships, Andrew Charalambous, Community Manager, and Benkort attended [EMURGO’s](https://www.emurgo.io/) CIP-1694 workshop in Tokyo. * The Foundation similarly organized a [CIP-1694 in Zug, Switzerland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xItSyRCo0Qw). Nicolas Cerny, Community Manager, [caught up with IOG’s Addie Girouard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LaILE8p75c&t=931s) to review some of the event’s highlights and main takeaways. During these events, Cardano community members joined representatives from the Cardano Foundation, IOG, and EMURGO to discuss the on-chain, decentralized governance mechanism for Voltaire. ## Testing on-chain governance ![Entering Voltaire - on-chain poll for SPOs](https://ucarecdn.com/6c70f51e-48fd-460b-af5d-87cc98c1f498/ \"Entering Voltaire - on-chain poll for SPOs\") The Foundation designed the recent SPO poll as a way of testing a potential governance mechanism. Polls could act as a reliable yet simple form of enabling the Cardano community to collectively make important decisions regarding network upgrades and protocol improvements. Like CIP-1964, on-chain polls rely on the decentralized and democratic nature of Cardano's governance model. The infrastructure introduced during Shelly built the foundation for decentralization, establishing a delegation and incentives scheme that encourages participation while deterring dishonest behavior. Voltaire will leverage this functionality and transition to a fully decentralized, self-sustaining network—a system where those maintaining the infrastructure and participating in on-chain delegation play a critical role in both the chain’s operational resilience and the actual decision-making process. As a first step, the Cardano Foundation [invited SPOs to participate in a poll experiment](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/entering-voltaire-on-chain-poll-for-spos/) conceived to ensure all involved parties had a voice in the procedures. The on-chain poll built on the mechanisms proposed by the Foundation in [CIP-0094](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/governance/cardano-improvement-proposals/cip-0094/) and asked SPOs for their stake-weighted opinion on potential changes to parameters, providing the Foundation with valuable insights into the community's needs and preferences. Additionally, it applied action 7 of the governance actions detailed in CIP-1694. When the Voltaire implementation is complete, such polls could become considerations for delegated representatives (DReps) who would have an influence proportional to the amount of support they received through delegation. Binding votes would complement these polls, allowing the Cardano community to make critical decisions on multiple proposals. The Foundation’s first on-chain poll for SPOs represents a step in this direction, testing the system while ensuring it is calibrated to generate robust proposals. To account for potential complications while running simultaneous contributions and collaborations, the initial phase occurred in a testnet environment. With the [testnet poll complete](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/entering-voltaire-on-chain-poll-for-spos/), the [mainnet poll](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/entering-voltaire-poll-experiment-live-on-mainnet/) inquired about the k parameter and its interaction with the absolute ada value for minimum pool cost, using for that straightforward multiple-choice questions. Specifically, there were six options, four of which addressed two variables: * Keep k at 500 and minPoolCost at 340 ada. * Keep k at 500 and halve minPoolCost to 170 ada. * Increase k to 1000 and keep minPoolCost at 340 ada. * Increase k to 1000 and halve minPoolCost to 170 ada. * I would prefer to abstain. * None of the above. The Cardano Foundation designed the poll to consider the perspectives of the entire Cardano community, hoping to trigger debates, contributions, and collaborations. The on-chain [poll results](https://adastat.net/polls/96861fe7da8d45ba5db95071ed3889ed1412929f33610636c072a4b5ab550211) are as follows (by stake pool): ![On-chain stake pool poll results chart](https://ucarecdn.com/9eaaa77f-145a-4876-b8d5-258e2b9fd985/ \"Stake pool results chart\") These results highlight the need to generate active participation in decision-making, especially because the Voltaire phase represents active, informed, and conscious participation at multiple levels of the Cardano ecosystem. All voices must be heard on the road towards a truly self-sustaining, genuinely decentralized network. For this reason, after the poll’s conclusion the Foundation has carefully considered and responded to the [Parameter Committee’s Recommendation in PCP-001](https://forum.cardano.org/t/the-cardano-foundations-response-to-the-parameter-committee-recommendation-in-pcp-001/121903), agreeing with their recommendation. Governance also underpins the ongoing [Cardano Summit Hackathon](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-summit-hackathon/), for which submissions concluded on 18 September. The Summit Hackathon focuses on issues specific to the governance phase of Cardano, providing participants with an opportunity to showcase their work and develop their skills. More specifically, the Hackathon will challenge participants to develop projects that promote transparency in governance, contributing to the operational resilience of the network. The Cardano Foundation thanks all participants for their submissions, and we look forward to the winner's announcement during the Summit’s [Gala Awards Dinner](https://tickets.summit.cardano.org/product/gala-awards-dinner/) in Dubai.","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/a6bf0f84-3350-44fd-b844-16242a245049/","default_content":"The Valentine Hard Fork aimed to increase cross-chain interoperability, participating in the governance standards workshop, and testing on-chain governance"},"name":"driving-blockchain-technology-cardano-foundation’s-activities-part-4.md","sha":"38181035ebfec08d85e4feeddd3948c61c543333","resource_href":"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/driving-blockchain-technology-cardano-foundation’s-activities-part-4/"},{"title":"State of the Cardano Developer Ecosystem: 2023 Edition","language":"en","banner_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/bc1c03e5-484f-4c9b-9af2-8c572021fc05/","meta_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/b2b2a8d6-dc27-4616-a07f-ea3a81fe2fe3/","thumbnail_image":"https://ucarecdn.com/7f155c61-7436-4023-815e-15bde732d316/","layout":"news","news_item_content":{"show_excerpt":"true","date":"2023-09-28T16:42:13.539Z","author":"https://ucarecdn.com/b192352a-1e03-437b-84a7-f8384c14f61f/-/crop/2871x3517/0,0/-/preview/|Matthias Benkort~~~Technical Director of Open Source Development","body":"The constant effort and the dedication of the Cardano developer community, along with their knowledge-sharing nature, have proven instrumental to a thriving ecosystem. Equipping them with the best tools and information ensures they have the necessary means to continue problem-solving and building solutions. Ultimately, it helps maintain a strong, secure blockchain that simultaneously fosters and rewards innovation as well as collaboration. As such, the Cardano Foundation is pleased to today launch the second edition of the Annual State of the Cardano Developer Ecosystem. This survey provides a way of assessing the current technical landscape while also identifying potential gaps. In addition to a more in-depth overview of the technical Cardano ecosystem, the survey should likewise allow the Foundation, along with anyone building tools within the ecosystem, to better understand the composition of the developer community and what tools they prefer to use. Crucially, the Foundation wishes to understand where the developer community sees opportunity and where they experience pain points while using the current Cardano programming stack. This second edition of the Cardano Developer Ecosystem survey follows a successful introduction last year. The report for the 2023 edition, along with an interpretation of the results, will again be open source so that the community can fully access the information and perform further analysis. The full rationale of the survey itself follows the Foundation’s commitment to driving the open source maturity of the Cardano ecosystem. The Cardano Foundation sees the advancement of open source technologies, done in collaboration with the community and various enterprise players, as a vital step towards a sustainable and robust Cardano ecosystem. On the enterprise side, an open source approach facilitates the creation of technologies that accommodate specific needs and adequately update to incorporate new possibilities. At the same time, for the community it ensures an egalitarian, innovative space that allows all developers to build upon and improve vital tools for the future of the network. As part of this focus on open source, the Foundation plans to soon release more open source repositories. This annual survey will also ensure we can continue that important work. In fact, it might happen that the relevance of such new open source repositories will appear in the survey results of forthcoming years. The 2023 survey will run for two weeks and should take about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. **[TAKE THE SURVEY](https://cardanofoundation.outgrow.us/cardano-developer-ecosystem-survey-2023)** [](https://cardanofoundation.outgrow.us/cardano-developer-ecosystem-survey-2023)","image":"https://ucarecdn.com/f26220ae-02cc-46b7-a8bb-a5a012c9c50a/","cat":"all","default_content":"The survey helps assess the current technical landscape and identify potential gaps.
